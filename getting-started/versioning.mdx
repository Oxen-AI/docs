# 💾 Oxen Versioning 101

The first thing you need to know about Oxen.ai is that allows to add files directly to the remote without pulling any data locally. If you want to make a contribution to a dataset with [1 Million Files](/features/performance), you do not want to wait to clone all the files locally just to add yours.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from oxen import RemoteRepo

  # Connect your client
  repo = RemoteRepo("my-username/my-repo")
  # Upload the image
  repo.add("images/image_1_000_001.png")
  # Commit to the main branch
  repo.commit("Adding the 1,000,001st image to the dataset")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This is just one example of how Oxen.ai enables a more developer friendly workflow for large datasets. There are also optimizations under the hood such as parallel file transfer, scalable merkle trees, and data deduplication to make Oxen go brrr (or mooo?).

Oxen.ai's comprised of a [command line interface](/getting-started/cli), as well as bindings for [Rust](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen) 🦀, [Python](/getting-started/python) 🐍, and [HTTP interfaces](/http-api) 🌎 to make it easy to integrate into your workflow.

## ✅ Features

Oxen.ai is built around ergonomics, ease of use, and it is easy to learn. If you know how to use git, you know how to use Oxen. The main difference is that data is a first class citizen in Oxen. The interface allows you to view, edit, query, and version your data as well as your code.

### Web Hub Features

The Oxen Web Hub is an easy to use web interface that allows you to discover and explore datasets without having to download them. You can also upload files directly, add permissions, and explore branches directly in the interface.

* 🔎 [Explore Datasets](/features/exploring_data): View and query your data in a beautiful interface

* 🏷️ [Labeling Workflows](/features/labeling_data): Edit data from the UI, or build your own labeling workflows

* 🤝 [Collaboration](/features/collaboration): Share datasets, models, and code with your team 

* 📝 [Notebooks](/features/notebooks): Spin up a Python Notebook on a GPU in seconds

* 🚀 [Model Inference](/features/models): Run an LLM on your dataset simply by writing a prompt

### Open Source Features

The tooling behind the Oxen.ai is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/oxen-release). This includes the powerful command line interface, oxen server, python library, and the HTTP API. The Oxen.ai web interface is built on top of the open source tooling, and can be deployed on your own infrastructure as a part of our [enterprise offering](https://www.oxen.ai/pricing).

* 🔥 Fast: Efficient indexing and syncing of any dataset size (millions of images? no problem)

* 🌎 [Workspaces](/concepts/workspaces): Interact with your data without downloading it

* 🧠 Intuitive: Same commands as git

* 💪 Handles large, unstructured files: images, videos, audio, text, parquet, arrow, json, models, etc

* 📊 Native DataFrame processing: index, compare and serve up DataFrames

* 📈 Versioning: Never worry about losing the state of your data

* 🤝 Distributed Collaboration: sync to an oxen-server

## 🌾 What kind of data?

Oxen.ai is designed to efficiently manage large datasets, including those with large individual files, for example CSV files with millions of rows. It also handles datasets comprising millions of individual files and directories such as the complete collection of ImageNet images.

The backend is agnostic to data type, so feel free to add any binary blobs. We automatically detect certain data types on upload so that we can render them within the UI. Specifically filetypes such as csv, tsv, jsonl, parquet, arrow turn into beautiful data tables. Images, audio, and video files will also play natively.

## 🚀 Built for speed

One of the main reasons datasets are hard to maintain is the pure performance of indexing the data and transferring the data over the network. We wanted to be able to index hundreds of thousands of images, videos, audio files, and text files in seconds.

Watch below as we version **hundreds of thousands of images** in seconds 🔥

</p>

But speed is only the beginning. Think of Oxen.ai as a set of building blocks to build your dream workflow on top of.

## ⚒️ Installation

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  brew tap Oxen-AI/oxen
  brew install oxen
  ```

  ```bash Python
  pip install oxenai
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## ⬇️ Cloning Datasets

The fastest way to get up and running with oxen is by cloning a dataset. Explore the many public datasets we have today on the [OxenHub](https://oxen.ai/explore).

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox
  ```

  ```python Python
  import oxen

  # Clone the repository
  repo = oxen.clone("ox/CatDogBBox")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## ⬆️ Pushing Datasets

Create and share your own repository to share your datasets with your team or the world by pushing them to [OxenHub](https://oxen.ai).

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash CLI
  # New repos can also be create in UI
  oxen add .
  oxen commit -m "message"
  oxen create-remote --name <namespace>/<repo_name>
  oxen config --set-remote origin https://hub.oxen.ai/<namespace>/<repo_name>
  oxen push origin main
  ```

  ```python Python
  import os
  from oxen import Repo

  # Instantiate a Repo object and create the repo directory
  repo = Repo("/path/to/data", mkdir=True)
  # Initialize the repository
  repo.init()
  # Write data to a file
  data_path = os.path.join(repo.path, "people.csv")
  with open(data_path, "w") as f:
      f.write("name,age\nbob,12\njane,13")
  # Stage the data for commit
  repo.add(data_path)
  # Commit the changes with a message
  repo.commit("Adding my data")

  # Set where to push the data to (replace <namespace> and <repo_name> with your remote)
  repo.set_remote("origin", "https://hub.oxen.ai/<namespace>/<repo_name>")

  # Push the changes to the remote
  repo.push()
  ```
