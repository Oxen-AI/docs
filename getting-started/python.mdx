## Install

```bash
$ pip install oxenai
```

## Clone Repository

Clone a repository from the [Oxen Hub](https://oxen.ai) or a your own [oxen-server](/getting-started/oxen-server). Detailed documentation for the [clone](/python-api/clone) method can be found in the [API Documentation](/python-api).

```python
import oxen
oxen.clone("ox/SpanishToEnglish")
```

This will create a directory called `SpanishToEnglish` in your current working directory and download the latest version of the repository.

## Setup User

In order for Oxen to know who is committing and where to sync to by default, you must call [config_user](/python-api/user) and pass in the name and email you would like to use in your commit messages.

```python
from oxen.user import config_user
config_user("YOUR NAME", "YOUR EMAIL")
```

This will save a file in `~/.config/oxen/user_config.toml` that contains your user configuration.

## Initialize Repository

If you are creating a new repository from scratch, you can initialize it with the [init](/python-api/init) method.

```python
import oxen
import os

# Create an empty directory named MyNewRepo
directory = "MyNewRepo"
os.makedirs(directory)

# Initialize the Oxen Repository
repo = oxen.init(directory)
```

This will create a `.oxen` directory to keep track of changes as you make them.

## Load Existing Repository

Use the [LocalRepo](/python-api/localrepo) class to interact with a repository that has already been initialized.

```python
from oxen import LocalRepo

# Load the repostory from the MyNewRepo directory
repo = LocalRepo("MyNewRepo")
# Check the status of the repository
print(repo.status())
```

## Add Files

Now let's create a README.md file and [add](/python-api/local_repo#add) it to the local staging area. This will not commit the changes to the repository, but it will prepare them to be committed.

```python
# ... continue from previous example

# Create a README.md file
filename = os.path.join(repo.path, "README.md")
with open(filename, "w") as f:
    f.write("# My New Repo")

# Add the README.md file to the staging area
repo.add(filename)

# Confirm that the file has been staged
print(repo.status())
```

## Commit Changes

Now that we have added the README.md file to the staging area, we can commit the changes to the repository.

```python
# ... continue from previous example

# Commit the changes to the repository
repo.commit("Adding README.md")
```

## Configure Auth

You can obtain an `auth_token` by creating an account on [Oxen.ai](https://oxen.ai) and going to your profile.

<img
  className="block"
  src="/images/auth_key.png"
  alt="Oxen.ai authentication key"
/>

To set your auth token, you can either set it in the `user_config.toml` file or you can set it through the python interface.

```python
from oxen.auth import config_auth
config_auth("hub.oxen.ai", "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN")
```

You can also set up your own [oxen-server](/getting-started/oxen-server) and generate custom auth tokens there.
