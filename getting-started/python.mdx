## Install

```bash
$ pip install oxenai
```

There are two ways to interact with Oxen in the python library:

1) A [Local Repository](/python/local_repo) where the full data is downloaded to your machine.
2) A [Remote Repository](/python/remote_repo) where you can interact with the data remotely and selectively download the data you need.

## Local Repository

[LocalRepo](/python/local_repo)

If you are creating a new repository from scratch, this is a great place to start. The workflow is very similar to [git](https://git-scm.com/) in terms of initializing a repository, adding data, committing, and pushing to a remote.

Let's walk through some basic operations.

### Configure User

In order for Oxen to know who is committing and where to sync to by default, you must configure your user and default host.

First create an Oxen config file in your home directory.

```bash
mkdir ~/.oxen
nano ~/.oxen/user_config.toml 
```

Then populate it with the required information. 

```bash
name = "YOUR NAME" 
email = "YOUR EMAIL"
default_host = "hub.oxen.ai"

[[host_configs]]
host = "hub.oxen.ai"
auth_token = "<YOUR AUTH TOKEN FROM OXEN>"
```

You can obtain an `auth_token` by creating an account on [Oxen.ai](https://oxen.ai) and going to your profile.

You can also set up your own [oxen-server](/getting-started/oxen-server) and generate custom auth tokens there.

### Init

Assuming you are creating a brand new repository, first you will have to create an empty directory, point your `LocalRepo` to it and run `init()`.

```python
import os
from oxen import LocalRepo

# Create an empty directory named CatsAndDogs
directory = "CatsAndDogs"
os.makedirs(directory)

# Initialize the Oxen Repository
repo = LocalRepo(directory)
repo.init()
```

### Add Files

Now let's create a README.md file and add it to the local staging area.

```python
import os
from oxen import LocalRepo

# write a file called README.md to disk
directory = "CatsAndDogs"
file_name = "README.md"
file_path = os.path.join(directory, file_name)

# Open the file in write mode
with open(file_path, "w") as file:
    # Write the title to the file
    file.write("# " + directory + "\n")

# Assuming the LocalRepo is already initialized
repo = LocalRepo(directory)
# add the path relative to the dir
repo.add(file_name)
# list added files
status = repo.status()
print(status.added_files())
```

You should see that we have one file added `[README.md]`

### Commit Staged Files

With your README.md staged you can now commit with a message

```python
from oxen import LocalRepo

# Assuming you have already added the data
repo = LocalRepo(directory)
repo.commit("Adding README.md")
```

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations you have just versioned your first file! Now to sync it with the rest of your team.

### Configure Remote

The easiest way to create a remote is in the [Oxen Hub web interface](https://oxen.ai). 

<img
  className="block"
  src="/images/MyRepos.png"
  alt="Oxen.ai authentication key"
/>

Then once you have a remote created, set the remote on the repo object.

```python
from oxen import LocalRepo

# Once you have data committed that you want to sync
repo = LocalRepo(directory)
# You can have multiple named remotes
username = "YOUR_USERNAME"
repo_name = "REMOTE_REPO_NAME"
remote_name = "origin"
remote_url = f"https://hub.oxen.ai/{username}/{repo_name}"
repo.set_remote(remote_name, remote_url)
```

### Push to Remote

With your remote set and auth key configured, you are ready to push the data!

```python
from oxen import LocalRepo

# Once you have committed data and set the remote, it's time to push your branch
repo = LocalRepo(directory)
remote_name = "origin"
remote_branch = "main"
repo.push(remote_name, remote_branch)
```
