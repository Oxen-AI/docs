title: ðŸš€ Model Inference

At the end of the day, AI is about automating workflows and making sure your model performs well given your data. 

[Oxen.ai](https://oxen.ai) makes it easy to run models on your data. With Oxen, you can either kick off [compute jobs](#compute-jobs) on the [Oxen.ai Hub](https://hub.oxen.ai) or you can [write your own custom code](#logging-model-results) to log model results to an Oxen repository.

# Kicking off Compute Jobs

As an easy way to get started, you can use the [Oxen.ai Hub](https://hub.oxen.ai) to test out different models on your data.

The Oxen.ai Hub currently supports LLM and Embedding models for Text, but we are working on adding support for more model modalities including Vision and Audio.

{/* 
The current list of supported models (as of October 2024) includes:

**OpenAI**

- `gpt-4o`
- `gpt-4o-mini`
- `text-embedding-3-small`
- `text-embedding-3-large` */}

<Warning>Currently the only model supported is `gpt-4o`. We are working on adding support for more models.</Warning>

## Grab a Dataset

For a demo, we'll use a [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.oxen.ai/ox/spam-classification/file/main/test.parquet). The goal of this dataset is to classify whether a given text is spam or ham (not spam).

To get started, you can download the 200 row dataset [here](https://hub.oxen.ai/api/repos/ox/spam-classification/file/main/test.parquet).

By the end of this tutorial, we will have processed our dataset through an LLM to classify whether a given text is spam or ham.

## Upload Dataset

Once you have the [sample dataset](https://hub.oxen.ai/api/repos/ox/spam-classification/file/main/test.parquet) downloaded, you can upload it to an Oxen repository by clicking the `+` button in the top-right of the UI and selecting `Create Repository` then choosing `Add Files`.

Once the dataset is uploaded, you should see it in the file list.

Clicking on the file will allow you to preview the data.

## Select a Model

Start by clicking the `ðŸš€` icon in the top-right above the data preview. This will open up a Prompt UI where you can select a task type, model, and setup your prompt.

<Warning>Currently the only model supported is `gpt-4o`. We are working on adding support for more models.</Warning>

![create-prompt](/images/spam-or-ham-prompt.png)

Once you are happy with your prompt, click the `Run Sample` button. This will run the model on the first 5 rows of data and show you the results.

You can either `Run Again` with a different prompt until you are satisfied with the results or you click `Next` to configure where the results should be written.
