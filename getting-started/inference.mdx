## Model API

Oxen.ai's API allows you to start building on top of the [latest and greatest models](https://oxen.ai/ai/models) and deploy fine-tuned models with a single API. If a model is too slow, costly, inaccurate, or if you want full control of the weights, you can use our [one-click interface to fine-tune](/getting-started/fine-tuning) and deploy a custom model using the same interface.

## All your modalities, in one place

Whether you want to generate text, images, or videos, Oxen.ai has you covered. If you want any other modality or model, reach out at [support@oxen.ai](mailto:support@oxen.ai) and we'll be happy to add your use-case to the platform.

Checkout the documentation for each modality to learn more about how to use them.
