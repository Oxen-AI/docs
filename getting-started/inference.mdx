title: ⚡️ Model Inference

Whether it is a model from the labs or your own [fine-tuned model](/features/fine-tuning), Oxen.ai exposes endpoints and a chat interface to test out a variety of models with a unified interface. This allows you to start building and hot swap models in your application right away.

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://hub.oxen.ai/api/chat/completions \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $OXEN_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "model": "openai:gpt-4o-mini",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}]
}'
```

```python Python
import openai
import os

client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key=os.getenv("OXEN_API_KEY"),
    base_url="https://hub.oxen.ai/api"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai:gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is a great name for an ox that also manages your AI infrastructure?"}]
)

print(response.output['content'][0]['text'])

# Chat Interface

The Oxen.ai chat interface is a simple web interface that allows you to try the latest and greatest models right away. The same interface can be used for models that you [fine-tuned](/features/fine-tuning) yourself.

Feel free to experiment with a model and see how it performs before you decide to use it in your application.

# API Endpoints

Once you feel confident in a model, you can use the API endpoints to integrate it into your application. The API endpoints allow you to test out a variety of models with a single API key. It's a great way to get started with a new model or to test out a new use case.

The API is OpenAI-compatible, so you can use any compatible client to interact with the model. Simply prepend the model name with a provider like `openai:gpt-4o-mini` and use `https://hub.oxen.ai/api` as your `base_url`.

The currently supported list of providers is:

- `openai`
- `anthropic`
- `fireworks`
- `google`
- `mistral`
- `deepseek`
- `oxenai` (for fine-tuned models)

To see the list of generally available models, visit the [models page](https://oxen.ai/ai/models).
