## Clone Repository

There's a few ways to clone an Oxen repository, depending on the level of data transfer you want to incur. The default `oxen clone` with no flags will download the *latest commit* from the `main` branch.

```bash
oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox
```
To clone from a specific branch, you can use the `-b` flag.

```bash
oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox -b my-pets
```
This creates a new directory `CatDogBBox` in which the files from the latest commit are downloaded, and a `.oxen` folder containing the [Merkle Tree](https://ghost.oxen.ai/merkle-tree-101/) for each commit in the branch's history and metadata for the repository. 

### Clone all

To clone the commit history for every branch, you can use the `--all` flag.

```bash
oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox --all
```

This is useful if you want to migrate a repository to a new remote.

### Cloning a subtree

If you're only working with a subset of the repository, you can use the `--filter` and `--depth` flags to limit the clone to a subsection of the full tree. `--filter` selects the directories to be cloned, while `--depth` limits how many subdirectories can be recursed into. 

```bash
oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox --filter annotations --depth 1
```

This clones the subtree of the commit that starts at annotations directory, without recursing into any new subdirectories. Only the files and merkle tree nodes from the `annotations` directory will be pulled locally. 

### Remote Mode

If you're working with a larger repository than you can store on your local device, you can clone the repository in Remote Mode to get the commit merkle trees without downloading the files.

```bash
oxen clone --remote https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox 
```

In remote-mode repositories, you can download individual files or directories with `oxen restore`. 

```bash 
oxen restore path/to/file
```

This is useful if you want to view the state of the repository locally without waiting for all its files to download. 

## Set Remote

If create a repo locally, you can use `oxen config --set-remote` to point it to a repository that's hosted remotely. This allows you to `fetch` or `pull` from that repository.

```bash
oxen config --set-remote origin https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox
```
To set a remote, use the URL of the remote repository and specify a name to associate it with on the local repo. By default, cloned repositories will use the name 'origin' for their remote.

You can use this command to change a local repository's remotes or add new ones. A repo can have multiple remotes, although most oxen commands that interact with a remote repository will default to 'origin' if no remote is specified.

## Pull Changes

Once you have a local repo with a remote, you can `pull` the latest changes for a branch. This fetches any new commits, downloading their files and commit merkle trees, and then checks out the latest commit in the working directory

```bash
oxen pull origin main
```

If no arguments are provided, the remote defaults to `origin` and branch defaults to `main`

```bash
oxen pull
```

As with `clone`, you can pull all branches with `--all`

```bash
oxen pull --all 
```

## Fetch Changes

If you want to fetch the latest changes without checking them out in the working directory, you can use `oxen fetch`

```bash
oxen fetch
```

## Download Data

If you want to download specific files or directories with the `oxen download` command.

```bash
oxen download ox/CatDogBBox test.csv
```
You can download from a specific revision (either a branch or commit id) with the `--revision` flag

```bash
oxen download ox/CatDogBBox path/to/folder --revision commit_or_branch_name
```
