## Oxen Node

`oxen node` can be used to inspect file and dir nodes in the merkle tree. This can be used to check whether nodes exist and have been created properly in the merkle tree. You can search for a node by hash or by path.

```bash
oxen node -h e3817ab123be09cd0b3d
```

```bash
oxen node path/to/file.txt
```

## Oxen Tree

You can use `oxen tree` to view the current state of the merkle tree for a commit.

```bash
oxen tree
```

## Concurrency

By default, oxen will use up to 8 threads for its parallelized operations (`oxen add`, `oxen push`, etc.). This can be configured via the `OXEN_NUM_THREADS` environment variable. If `OXEN_NUM_THREADS` is set, oxen will instead use that many threads, so long as they are available on the local machine.

```bash
export OXEN_NUM_THREADS="16"
```

## HTTP Requests

When uploading or downloading data, if any files fail to transfer, oxen will wait and retry the request. By default, oxen will allow up to 10 retries before cancelling the operation. This can be configured via the enviornment variable `NUM_HTTP_REQUESTS`/

```bash 
export NUM_HTTP_RETRIES="10"
```

All HTTP requests oxen makes timeout after 120 seconds by default. You can configure this the OXEN_TIMEOUT_SECS variable.

```bash 
export OXEN_TIMEOUT_SECS="10"
```

## Chunk Size

Under the hood, oxen groups files into `small files` and `large files` for more efficient transfer in `oxen push`, `oxen workspace add`, etc. Files are considered `large` if they're larger than `AVG_CHUNK_SIZE`, which is set to 10 MB by default. This can be configured via the `AVG_CHUNK_SIZE` environment variable

```bash
export AVG_CHUNK_SIZE="20_000_000" 
```

## Debug Logs

The oxen codebase contains plenty of debug logs, which you can turn on with the RUST_LOG variable.

```bash
export RUST_LOG="debug"
```

You can also set RUST_LOG to `info` or `warn` for more restrictive debug logs
