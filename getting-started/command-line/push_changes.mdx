## Push Changes

Once you've committed changes to a local repository, you can push them to a remote with `oxen push`

```bash
oxen push origin main
```

If you don't supply a remote name or branch, they default to `origin` and the current branch respectively.

```bash
oxen push
```

### Resume Push

If a push is cancelled partway through, you can use the `--missing-files` flag to resume push progress and upload the remaining files

```bash
oxen push --missing-files
```
## Set Remote

You can use `oxen config --set-remote` to set the remote for a repository. This allows you to push changes to that remote, provided you've set the API key and have permission.

```bash
oxen config --set-remote origin https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox
```

## View Remotes

The `oxen remote` command allows you to view what remotes you have for a repository

```bash
oxen remote
```
```
origin
```

Use the `--verbose` flag to list the remotes with their URLs

```bash
oxen remote -valid
```
```
origin  https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox
local_dev   http://localhost:3000/ox/CatDogBBox
```

## Create Remote

You can also create a remote from the CLI with `oxen create-remote`.

```bash
oxen create-remote --host hub.oxen.ai --scheme https --name ox/SampleRepo
```

## Workspaces

You can also stage changes to a remote by using a [Workspace](/concepts/workspaces). This allows you to skip copying files to a local repository, making it ideal for bulk imports.

Create a workspace on a branch with `oxen workspace create`

```bash
oxen workspace create
```

You can then add the files with `oxen workspace add`, uploading their contents to the remote and staging them for commit

```bash
oxen workspace add images --workspace-id 117abd2d-3363-497d-ac93-a5cb3c280234
```

Then, commit the changes with `oxen workspace commit`

```bash
oxen workspace commit -m "Uploading Images" --workspace-id 117abd2d-3363-497d-ac93-a5cb3c280234
```
