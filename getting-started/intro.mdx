## üêÇ Why Build Oxen?

Oxen was build by a team of machine learning engineers, who have spent countless hours in their careers managing datasets. We have used many different tools, but none of them were as easy to use and as ergonomic as we would like. 

If you have ever tried [git lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) to version large datasets and became frustrated, we feel your pain. If you have ever uploaded a dataset to a cloud storage bucket with the name:

`images_july_2022_final_2_no_really_final.tar.gz`

We feel your pain. We built Oxen to be the tool we wish we had.

## ü§ñ Built for AI

If you are building an AI application, data is the lifeblood. Whether you are building your own model from scratch, fine-tuning a pre-trained model, or using a model as a service, you will need to manage and compare datasets over time. We version our code, why not our data?

Versioning machine learning data is like brushing your teeth. You know you should do it, but it‚Äôs been a pain and you don‚Äôt do it as often as you should...Until now.

## ‚úÖ Features

One of the reasons versioning data has been a pain in the past is the pure speed. Don't let the üêÇ fool you. Yes Oxen are strong, reliable creatures, but when it comes to big data they are also fast.

When we say fast, [we mean fast](/concepts/performance). Oxen can commit hundreds of thousands of images in a matter of seconds üöÄ

Speed is only the beginning. Oxen is built to be easy to use, and easy to learn. If you know how to use git, you know how to use Oxen.

* üî• Fast (10-100x faster than existing tools)
* üß† Easy to learn (same commands as git)
* üóÑÔ∏è Index lots of files (millions of images, no problem)
* üé• Handles large files (images, videos, audio, text, parquet, arrow, json, machine learning models, etc)
* üìä Native data frame library to compare data ([oxen df](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/oxen-release/blob/main/DataFrames.md) command for data exploration)
* üìà Tracks changes over time (never worry about losing the state of your data)
* ü§ù Collaborate with your team (sync to an oxen-server)
* üåé [Remote Workspaces](https://docs.oxen.ai/concepts/remote-workspace) to interact with the data without downloading it
* üëÄ Better data visualization on [OxenHub](https://oxen.ai)


## üìö Learn the Basics

No need to learn a new paradigm.

The Oxen Command Line Interface (CLI) mirrors [git](https://git-scm.com/) in many ways, so if you are comfortable versioning code with git, it will be straightforward to version your datasets with Oxen.

</p>

## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting Started

Oxen makes versioning your datasets as easy as versioning your code. You can install through homebrew or pip or from our [releases page](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen/releases).

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
brew tap Oxen-AI/oxen
brew install oxen
```

```bash Python
pip install oxenai
```

</CodeGroup>

### Create Repository

Initialize your first Oxen repository, and make your first commit

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen init
printf '%s\n' 'name,age' 'bob,12' 'jane,13' > people.csv
oxen add people.csv
oxen commit -m "Adding my data"
```

```python Python
import os
from oxen import LocalRepo

# Instantiate a LocalRepo object and create the repo directory
repo = LocalRepo("/path/to/data", mkdir=True)
# Initialize the repository
repo.init()
# Write data to a file
data_path = os.path.join(repo.path, "people.csv")
with open(data_path, "w") as f:
    f.write("name,age\nbob,12\njane,13")
# Stage the data for commit
repo.add(data_path)
# Commit the changes with a message
repo.commit("Adding my data")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Version Your Data

Once your data has been committed, you can always return to that version.

Confidently overwrite the file, move the file, delete the file, it doesn't matter. Oxen will always have a copy of the data at the time of the previous commit.

It is good practice to create a new branch for changes you make to your data. This will allow you to easily compare the parallel versions of your data over time.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen checkout -b modify-data
printf '%s\n' 'name,age' 'bob,12' 'jane,13' 'joe,14' > people.csv
```

```python Python
import os
from oxen import LocalRepo

repo = LocalRepo("/path/to/data")
# Create a new branch
repo.checkout("modify-data", create=True)
# Overwrite data in existing file
data_path = os.path.join(repo.path, "people.csv")
with open(data_path, "w") as f:
    f.write("name,age\nbob,12\njane,13\njoe,14")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Compare Changes

View the change you made with the `oxen diff` command. This will show you the changes you made to your data since the last commit.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen diff people.csv
```

```python Python
# TODO: implement python wrapper
```

</CodeGroup>

### Revert Changes

If you are not happy with the changes you made to your data, you can revert them to the previous commit with the `oxen restore` command.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen restore people.csv
```

```python Python
# TODO: implement python wrapper
```

</CodeGroup>

### Commit Changes

Once you are happy with the changes you have made to your data, you can commit them to the repository with a new message.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen add people.csv
oxen commit -m "Adding Joe to the dataset"
```

```python Python
from oxen import LocalRepo

repo = LocalRepo("/path/to/data")
# Stage the data for commit
data_path = os.path.join(repo.path, "people.csv")
repo.add(data_path)
# Commit the changes with a message
repo.commit("Adding Joe to the dataset")
```

</CodeGroup>

### View History

To see the commit history of your repository, you can use the `oxen log` command.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen log
```

```python Python
from oxen import LocalRepo

# Instantiate a LocalRepo object
repo = LocalRepo("/path/to/data")
# Get the commit history
commits = repo.log()
```

</CodeGroup>

### Return To Main Branch

Once you are done making changes to your data, you can return to the main branch with the `oxen checkout` command.

Never fear, the file now has now been reverted to the inital commit again, but your changes will be saved in the branch you created.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen checkout main
```

```python Python
from oxen import LocalRepo

# Instantiate a LocalRepo object
repo = LocalRepo("/path/to/data")
# Checkout the main branch
repo.checkout("main")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Push Data

Once your data has been committed locally, you can sync it to the OxenHub.

OxenHub is a free service that allows you to collaborate on your data in the cloud. You can create a free account at [https://oxen.ai](https://oxen.ai).

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
# Go create repo at https://oxen.ai
# ...
oxen config --set-remote origin https://hub.oxen.ai/<namespace>/<repo_name>
oxen push origin main
# to push your other branch simply change the branch name from `main` to `modify-data`
```

```python Python
# Go create repo at https://oxen.ai
# ...
# Set where to push the data to (replace <namespace> and <repo_name> with your remote)
repo.set_remote("origin", "https://hub.oxen.ai/<namespace>/<repo_name>")
# Push the changes to the remote
repo.push()
```

</CodeGroup>

### Clone Data

Clone your data faster than ever before. Oxen has been optimized to the core to make pulling large datasets as fast as possible.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox
```

```python Python
from oxen import LocalRepo

# Clone the repository
repo = LocalRepo("/path/to/dst")
repo = LocalRepo.clone("https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Pull Changes

Only pull the changes you need. Oxen will only pull the files that have changed since the last time you pulled.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen pull origin main
```

```python Python
from oxen import LocalRepo
repo = LocalRepo("/path/to/repo")
repo.pull()
```

</CodeGroup>

### Download Individual Files

With Oxen you do not need to download the entire dataset to your local machine. You can download only the subset of files or directories you need.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen clone http://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox --shallow
cd CatDogBBox
oxen remote download annotations/test.csv
```

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo
repo = RemoteRepo("http://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox")
repo.download("annotations/test.csv")
```

</CodeGroup>

## üêÇ Why the name Oxen?

‚ÄúOxen‚Äù comes from the fact that we will plow, maintain, and version your data like a good farmer tends to their fields üåæ. During the agricultural revolution, the plow and offloading work to Oxen helped people specialize and start working on other important societal tasks. Let Oxen take care of the grunt work of your infrastructure so you can focus on the higher-level ML problems that matter to your product.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Every GitHub Star Gives an Ox its Wings

No really.

We hooked up the GitHub webhook for stars to an [OxenHub repository](https://www.oxen.ai/ox/FlyingOxen). Using a combination of Oxen's [python library](https://docs.oxen.ai/getting-started/python), [remote workspaces](https://docs.oxen.ai/concepts/remote-workspace), and [Stable Diffusion XL](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/stable_diffusion_xl) we generate a unique Ox for each user, and attempt to give them wings.

Go find your own in our [ox/FlyingOxen](https://www.oxen.ai/ox/FlyingOxen) repository.
