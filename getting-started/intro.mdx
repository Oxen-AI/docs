## 🤷‍♂️ Why Should I Care?

If you are building an AI application, data is the lifeblood. Whether you are building your own model from scratch, fine-tuning a pre-trained model, or using a model as a service, you will need to manage and compare datasets over time. We version our code, why not our data?

Versioning machine learning data is like brushing your teeth. You know you should do it, but it’s been a pain and you don’t do it as often as you should...Until now.

## 🔥 Oxen Is Fast

One of the reasons versioning data has been a pain in the past is the pure speed. Don't let the 🐂 fool you. Yes Oxen are strong, reliable creatures, but when it comes to big data they are also fast.

Many versioning tools out there are built for code or smaller datasets, not for large unstructured data. Oxen is built from the ground up, from first principles, to be fast, scalable, and easy to use for modern machine learning datasets that may include images, video, audio and text.

When we say fast, [we mean fast](/concepts/performance). Oxen can commit hundreds of thousands of images in a matter of seconds.

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

Oxen makes versioning your datasets as easy as versioning your code.

```bash
oxen init
oxen add images/
oxen commit -m "Adding my data"
oxen config --set-remote origin https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox
oxen push origin main
```

Clone your data faster than ever before.

```bash
oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox
```

## 📚 Learn the Basics

No need to learn a new paradigm.

The Oxen Command Line Interface (CLI) mirrors [git](https://git-scm.com/) in many ways, so if you are comfortable versioning code with git, it will be straightforward to version your datasets with Oxen.

Commit hundreds of thousands of images to an Oxen repository in a matter of seconds 🚀

## 🐂 Why the name Oxen?

“Oxen” comes from the fact that we will plow, maintain, and version your data like a good farmer tends to their fields 🌾. During the agricultural revolution, the plow and offloading work to Oxen helped people specialize and start working on other important societal tasks. Let Oxen take care of the grunt work of your infrastructure so you can focus on the higher-level ML problems that matter to your product.

## ⭐️ Every GitHub Star Gives an Ox its Wings

No really.

We hooked up the GitHub webhook for stars to an [OxenHub repository](https://www.oxen.ai/ox/FlyingOxen). Using a combination of Oxen's [python library](https://docs.oxen.ai/getting-started/python), [remote workspaces](https://docs.oxen.ai/concepts/remote-workspace), and [Stable Diffusion XL](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/stable_diffusion_xl) we generate a unique Ox for each user, and attempt to give them wings.

Go find your own in our [ox/FlyingOxen](https://www.oxen.ai/ox/FlyingOxen) repository.
