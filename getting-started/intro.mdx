## 🌾 Why Build Oxen?

Oxen was build by a team of machine learning engineers, who have spent countless hours in their careers managing datasets. We have used many different tools, but none of them were as easy to use and as ergonomic as we would like. 

If you have ever tried [git lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) to version large datasets and became frustrated, we feel your pain. Solutions like git-lfs are too slow when it comes to the scale of data we need for machine learning.

If you have ever uploaded a large dataset of images, audio, video, or text to a cloud storage bucket with the name:

`s3://data/images_july_2022_final_2_no_really_final.tar.gz`

We built Oxen to be the tool we wish we had.


## 🤖 Built for AI

If you are building an AI application, data is the lifeblood. Data is constantly changing over time, and data differentiates your model from the competition.

Whether you are building your own model from scratch, fine-tuning a pre-trained model, or using a model as a service, you will need to manage and compare the inputs and outputs over time to ensure your model is improving.

[We version our code, why not our data?](https://blog.oxen.ai/we-version-our-code-why-not-our-data/)

Versioning your data means you can experiment on models in parallel with different data. The more experiments you run, the smarter your model becomes, and more robust models lead to better products.

## 📚 Familiar Workflow

No need to learn a new paradigm.

The Oxen Command Line Interface (CLI) mirrors [git](https://git-scm.com/) in many ways, so if you are comfortable versioning code with git, it will be straightforward to version your datasets with Oxen.

The difference is Oxen is built for data. It is optimized to handle large files, and large datasets. It is [built to be fast](/concepts/performance), and easy to use.

## ⚒️ Install Oxen

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
brew tap Oxen-AI/oxen
brew install oxen
```

```bash Python
pip install oxenai
```

</CodeGroup>

## ⬇️ Clone Dataset

Clone your first Oxen repository from the [OxenHub](https://oxen.ai/explore).

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox
```

```python Python
import oxen

# Clone the repository
repo = oxen.clone("ox/CatDogBBox")
```

</CodeGroup>

## ✅ Features

One of the reasons versioning data has been a pain in the past is the pure speed. Don't let the 🐂 fool you. Yes Oxen are strong, reliable creatures, but when it comes to big data they are also fast.

When we say fast, [we mean fast](/concepts/performance). Oxen can commit hundreds of thousands of images in a matter of seconds 🚀

Speed is only the beginning. Oxen is built to be easy to use, and easy to learn. If you know how to use git, you know how to use Oxen.

* 🔥 Fast (10-100x faster than existing tools)
* 🧠 Easy to learn (same commands as git)
* 🗄️ Index lots of files (millions of images, no problem)
* 🎥 Handles large files (images, videos, audio, text, parquet, arrow, json, machine learning models, etc)
* 📊 Native data frame library to compare data ([oxen df](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/oxen-release/blob/main/DataFrames.md) command for data exploration)
* 📈 Tracks changes over time (never worry about losing the state of your data)
* 🤝 Collaborate with your team (sync to an oxen-server)
* 🌎 [Remote Workspaces](https://docs.oxen.ai/concepts/remote-workspace) to interact with the data without downloading it
* 👀 Better data visualization on [OxenHub](https://oxen.ai)

## 🤓 Compare Data Over Time

Use the [OxenHub](https://oxen.ai) to compare data over time. OxenHub is a web interface for your Oxen repositories. It is a great way to visualize your data, and view how your data has changed.

## 🐂 Why the name Oxen?

“Oxen” comes from the fact that we will plow, maintain, and version your data like a good farmer tends to their fields 🌾. During the agricultural revolution, the plow and offloading work to Oxen helped people specialize and start working on other important societal tasks. Let Oxen take care of the grunt work of your infrastructure so you can focus on the higher-level ML problems that matter to your product.

## ⭐️ Every GitHub Star Gives an Ox its Wings

No really.

We hooked up the GitHub webhook for stars to an [OxenHub repository](https://www.oxen.ai/ox/FlyingOxen). Using a combination of Oxen's [python library](https://docs.oxen.ai/getting-started/python), [remote workspaces](https://docs.oxen.ai/concepts/remote-workspace), and [Stable Diffusion XL](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/stable_diffusion_xl) we generate a unique Ox for each user, and attempt to give them wings.

Go find your own in our [ox/FlyingOxen](https://www.oxen.ai/ox/FlyingOxen) repository.
