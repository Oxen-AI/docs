## üêÇ Why Build Oxen?

Oxen was build by a team of machine learning engineers, who have spent countless hours in their careers managing datasets. We have used many different tools, but none of them were as easy to use and as ergonomic as we would like. 

If you have ever tried [git lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) or other solutions as a hack to version large datasets, we feel your pain. If you have ever uploaded a dataset to a cloud storage bucket with the name:

`images_july_2022_final_2_no_really_final.tar.gz`

We feel your pain. We built Oxen to be the tool we wish we had.

## ü§ñ Built for AI

If you are building an AI application, data is the lifeblood. Whether you are building your own model from scratch, fine-tuning a pre-trained model, or using a model as a service, you will need to manage and compare datasets over time. We version our code, why not our data?

Versioning machine learning data is like brushing your teeth. You know you should do it, but it‚Äôs been a pain and you don‚Äôt do it as often as you should...Until now.

## üî• Oxen Is Fast

One of the reasons versioning data has been a pain in the past is the pure speed. Don't let the üêÇ fool you. Yes Oxen are strong, reliable creatures, but when it comes to big data they are also fast.

Many versioning tools out there are built for code or smaller datasets, not for large unstructured data. Oxen is built from the ground up, from first principles, to be fast, scalable, and easy to use for modern machine learning datasets that may include images, video, audio and text.

When we say fast, [we mean fast](/concepts/performance). Oxen can commit hundreds of thousands of images in a matter of seconds.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting Started

Oxen makes versioning your datasets as easy as versioning your code. You can install through homebrew or pip or from our [releases page](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen/releases).

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
brew tap Oxen-AI/oxen
brew install oxen
```

```bash Python
pip install oxenai
```

</CodeGroup>

### Create Repository

Initialize and push your first Oxen repository.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen init
echo "name,age\nbob,12\njane,13" > people.csv
oxen add people.csv
oxen commit -m "Adding my data"
# Go create repo at https://oxen.ai
# ...
oxen config --set-remote origin https://hub.oxen.ai/<namespace>/<repo_name>
oxen push origin main
```

```python Python
import os
from oxen import LocalRepo

# Instantiate a LocalRepo object and create the repo directory
repo = LocalRepo("/path/to/data", mkdir=True)
# Initialize the repository
repo.init()
# Write a data file
data_path = os.path.join(repo.path, "people.csv")
with open(data_path, "w") as f:
    f.write("name,age\nbob,12\njane,13")
# Stage a subdirectory in the repository for commit
repo.add(data_path)
# Commit the changes with a message
repo.commit("Adding my data")
# Go create repo at https://oxen.ai
# ...
# Set where to push the data to (replace <namespace> and <repo_name> with your remote)
repo.set_remote("origin", "https://hub.oxen.ai/<namespace>/<repo_name>")
# Push the changes to the remote
repo.push()
```

</CodeGroup>

### Clone Data

Clone your data faster than ever before. Oxen has been optimized to the core to make pulling large datasets as fast as possible.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox
```

```python Python
from oxen import LocalRepo

# Clone the repository
repo = LocalRepo("/path/to/repo")
repo = LocalRepo.clone("https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Pull Changes

Only pull the changes you need. Oxen will only pull the files that have changed since the last time you pulled.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen pull origin main
```

```python Python
from oxen import LocalRepo
repo = LocalRepo("/path/to/repo")
repo.pull()
```

</CodeGroup>

### Download Individual Files

With Oxen you do not need to download the entire dataset to your local machine. You can download only the subset of files or directories you need.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen clone http://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox --shallow
cd CatDogBBox
oxen remote download annotations/test.csv
```

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo
repo = RemoteRepo("http://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox")
repo.download("annotations/test.csv")
```

</CodeGroup>

## üìö Learn the Basics

No need to learn a new paradigm.

The Oxen Command Line Interface (CLI) mirrors [git](https://git-scm.com/) in many ways, so if you are comfortable versioning code with git, it will be straightforward to version your datasets with Oxen.

Commit hundreds of thousands of images to an Oxen repository in a matter of seconds üöÄ

## üêÇ Why the name Oxen?

‚ÄúOxen‚Äù comes from the fact that we will plow, maintain, and version your data like a good farmer tends to their fields üåæ. During the agricultural revolution, the plow and offloading work to Oxen helped people specialize and start working on other important societal tasks. Let Oxen take care of the grunt work of your infrastructure so you can focus on the higher-level ML problems that matter to your product.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Every GitHub Star Gives an Ox its Wings

No really.

We hooked up the GitHub webhook for stars to an [OxenHub repository](https://www.oxen.ai/ox/FlyingOxen). Using a combination of Oxen's [python library](https://docs.oxen.ai/getting-started/python), [remote workspaces](https://docs.oxen.ai/concepts/remote-workspace), and [Stable Diffusion XL](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/stable_diffusion_xl) we generate a unique Ox for each user, and attempt to give them wings.

Go find your own in our [ox/FlyingOxen](https://www.oxen.ai/ox/FlyingOxen) repository.
