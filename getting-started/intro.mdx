## Getting Started

Oxen makes versioning your datasets as easy as versioning your code.

```bash
# The first step for creating any dataset should be `oxen init`

oxen init
oxen add images/
oxen commit -m "Adding my data"
oxen config --set-remote origin https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBoundingBox
oxen push origin main
```

Clone your data faster than ever before.

```bash
# The first step in collaborating on a dataset should be `oxen clone`

oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBoundingBox
```

## Learn the Basics

No need to learn a new paradigm. 

The Oxen Command Line Interface (CLI) mirrors [git](https://git-scm.com/) in many ways, so if you are comfortable versioning code with git, it will be straightforward to version your datasets with Oxen.

Commit hundreds of thousands of images to an Oxen repository in a matter of seconds 🚀

## Features

Oxen was optimized to be fast on structured and unstructured data types. Unlike traditional version control systems that are optimized for text files and code, Oxen was built from the [ground up to be fast](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/oxen-release/blob/main/Performance.md) on images, video, audio, text, and more.

* 🔥 Fast (10-100x faster than existing tools)
* 🧠 Easy to learn (same commands as git)
* 🗄️ Index lots of files (millions of images? no problem)
* 🎥 Handles large files (images, videos, audio, text, parquet, arrow, json, models, etc)
* 📊 Native DataFrame processing ([oxen df](/concepts/data-frames) command for data exploration)
* 📈 Tracks changes over time (never worry about losing the state of your data)
* 🤝 Collaborate with your team (sync to an oxen-server)
* 👀 Better data visualization on [OxenHub](https://oxen.ai)


## Why the name Oxen?

“Oxen” 🐂 comes from the fact that we will plow, maintain, and version your data like a good farmer tends to their fields 🌾. Let Oxen take care of the grunt work of your infrastructure so you can focus on the higher-level ML problems that matter to your product.
