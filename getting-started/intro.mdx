Whether you are building [Generative AI](/use-cases/generative-ai), [Image Recognition](/use-cases/computer-vision), or [Text Classification](/use-cases/text-classification), Oxen is the key to managing your entire team‚Äôs data workflows. 

Collaboration is key when it comes to having the highest quality data for your machine learning models. Oxen‚Äô version control makes it easy to collaborate on datasets with your team, and with the ML community at large.

## Getting Started

Oxen makes versioning your datasets as easy as versioning your code.

```bash
# The first step for creating any dataset should be `oxen init`

oxen init
oxen add images/
oxen commit -m "Adding my data"
oxen config --set-remote origin https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox
oxen push origin main
```

Clone your data faster than ever before.

```bash
# The first step in collaborating on a dataset should be `oxen clone`

oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox
```

## Learn the Basics

No need to learn a new paradigm. 

The Oxen Command Line Interface (CLI) mirrors [git](https://git-scm.com/) in many ways, so if you are comfortable versioning code with git, it will be straightforward to version your datasets with Oxen.

Commit hundreds of thousands of images to an Oxen repository in a matter of seconds üöÄ

## Why the name Oxen?

‚ÄúOxen‚Äù üêÇ comes from the fact that we will plow, maintain, and version your data like a good farmer tends to their fields üåæ. During the agricultural revolution, the plow and offloading work to Oxen helped people specialize and start working on other important societal tasks. Let Oxen take care of the grunt work of your infrastructure so you can focus on the higher-level ML problems that matter to your product.
