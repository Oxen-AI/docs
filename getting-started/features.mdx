description: 'What separates Oxen from other version control systems?'
---

Oxen was optimized to be fast on structured and unstructured data types. Unlike traditional version control systems that are optimized for text files and code, Oxen was built from the [ground up to be fast](/concepts/performance) on images, video, audio, text, and more.

* 🔥 Fast (10-100x faster than existing tools)
* 🧠 Easy to learn (same commands as git)
* 🗄️ Index lots of files (millions of images? no problem)
* 🎥 Handles large files (images, videos, audio, text, parquet, arrow, json, models, etc)
* 📊 Native Data Frame processing ([oxen df](/concepts/data-frames) command for data exploration)
* 📈 Tracks changes over time (never worry about losing the state of your data)
* 🤝 Collaborate with your team (sync to an [oxen-server](/getting-started/oxen-server))
* 🌎 [Remote Workspaces](/concepts/remote-workspace) to interact with the data without downloading it
* 👀 Better data visualization on [OxenHub](https://oxen.ai)
