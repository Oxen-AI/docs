You can either setup an `oxen-server` instance yourself, or use the hosted version on [OxenHub](https://oxen.ai). To use the hosted OxenHub solution you can sign up [here](https://oxen.ai/register). The hosted solution comes with a UI and the benefits of not having to setup infrastructure yourself.

## Install

To setup a local Oxen Server instance, first install the `oxen-server` binary.

On Mac-OS you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install the binary.

```bash
brew tap Oxen-AI/oxen-server
```

```bash
brew install oxen-server
```

To install on other platforms, follow the [installation instructions](/getting-started/install).

## Run

The server can be run with access token authentication turned on or off. The server runs with no authentication by default:

```bash
oxen-server start
```

To enable authentication, generate a token to give it to the user to access to the server

```bash
oxen-server add-user --email YOUR_EMAIL --name YOUR_NAME

User access token created:

XXXXXXXX

To give user access have them run the command `oxen config --auth <HOST> <TOKEN>`
```

You may have different authentication tokens for different hosts. From the client side, you can setup an auth token per host with the `config` command. If you ever need to debug or edit the tokens manually, they are stored in the `~/.config/oxen/auth_config.toml` file.

```bash
oxen config --auth <HOST> <TOKEN>
cat ~/.config/oxen/auth_config.toml
```

To run the server with authentication, use the `-a` flag

```bash
oxen-server start -a
```

The default directory that Oxen stores data is `/tmp/oxen_sync`, we definitely do not want this in production. To change it set the SYNC_DIR environment variable to a path.

```
$ export SYNC_DIR=/Path/To/Data
oxen-server start -a

Running üêÇ server on 0.0.0.0:3000
Syncing to directory: /Path/To/Data
[2022-06-08T10:00:48Z INFO  actix_server::builder] Starting 8 workers
[2022-06-08T10:00:48Z INFO  actix_server::server] Actix runtime found; starting in Actix runtime
```

If you want to change the default `IP ADDRESS` and `PORT` you can do so by passing them in with the `-i` and `-p` parameters.

```bash
oxen-server start -i 0.0.0.0 -p 4321
```

## Pushing the Changes

Once you have committed data locally and are ready to share them with colleagues (or the world) you will have to push them to a remote.

You can either create a remote through the web UI on [OxenHub](https://oxen.ai) or if you have setup a server your self, you will have to run the `create-remote` command.

Note: The host and scheme are optional and default to `hub.oxen.ai` and `https` respectively. If you are running a local server, you can set the host to `localhost:3000` and the scheme to `http`.

```bash
oxen create-remote --name MyNamespace/MyRepoName --host localhost:3000 --scheme http
```

Repositories that live on an Oxen Server have the idea of a `namespace` and a `name` to help you organize your repositories.

Once you know your remote repository URL you can add it as a remote.

```bash
oxen config --set-remote origin http://<HOST>/MyNamespace/MyRepoName
```

Once a remote is set you can push

```bash
oxen push origin main
```

You can change the remote (origin) and the branch (main) to whichever remote and branch you want to push.

## Clone the Changes

To clone a repository from remote server you can use the URL you provided previously, and pull the changes to a new machine.

```bash
oxen clone http://<HOST>/MyNamespace/MyRepoName
```

Note: Due to the potential size of data, you can supply the `--shallow` flag so that oxen does not immediately pull all the data. You can then navigate into the directory, and pull the specific branch that you want.

```bash
oxen clone http://<HOST>/MyNamespace/MyRepoName --shallow
$ cd MyRepoName
oxen pull origin main
```
