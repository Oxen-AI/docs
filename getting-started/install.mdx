description: How to install the Oxen client, server, or python package.
---

## Command Line Tools

The Oxen client can be installed on MacOS via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or by downloading the relevant binaries for Linux or Windows.

You can find the source code for the client [here](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen) and can also build from source for your platform.

All binaries for MacOS, Linux, Windows and Docker are available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen/releases).

### Mac

```bash
brew install oxen
```

### Linux
#### Ubuntu
We provide .deb packages that can be installed directly on Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu.

First, download the release for your system's architecture.

For x86-64
```bash
$ wget https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen/releases/latest/download/oxen-linux-x86_64.deb
```

For ARM64
```bash
$ wget https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen/releases/latest/download/oxen-linux-arm64.deb
```

Then run
```bash
$ sudo dpkg -i oxen-linux-*.deb
```

#### Other distributions
We also provide distributions-agnostic binaries that can be installed on any Linux system.

First, download the release for your system's architecture.

For x86-64
```bash
$ wget https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen/releases/latest/download/oxen-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

For ARM64
```bash
$ wget https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen/releases/latest/download/oxen-linux-arm64.tar.gz
```

```bash
$ tar -xzvf oxen-linux-*.tar.gz
$ chmod +x oxen
$ mv oxen /usr/local/bin
```

### Windows
We provide Windows binaries as a .exe.
```bash
$ wget https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen/releases/latest/download/oxen-windows-x86_64.exe.zip
```

## Python Package

The easiest way to get started with the Oxen Python library is to use `uv`. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Install a supported Python version

```bash
$ uv python install 3.13
```

Then, create and init a new uv project.
```bash
$ mkdir my-python-script/ && cd my-python-script/
$ uv init
```

This will create a virtual environment with the latest installed Python version.

Next, add the oxen library to the project
```bash
$ uv add oxenai
```

Then, to test that everything is working, update `main.py` with the following code.
```python
import oxen
oxen.clone("ox/SpanishToEnglish")
```

Then run the script with `uv run` so it executes in the virtual environment.
```bash
$ uv run main.py
```

Note that this will only install the Python library and not the command line tool.

### Installing Oxen through Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab

Create and run this cell:
```python
!pip install oxenai
```

### Docker

We build many binary wheels for the Python library (and we're working on adding more), but if your container image doesn't work with one of our binary wheels, pip will have to build it from source. Here is a minimal Dockerfile for a Debian-based image that installs the prerequisites for building the Oxen library from source:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

RUN apt update
RUN apt install -y clang pkg-config libssl-dev curl

RUN curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
ENV PATH="/root/.cargo/bin:${PATH}"

RUN pip install oxenai
```

## Server Install

The Oxen server binary can be deployed where ever you want to store and backup your data. It is an HTTP server that the client communicates with to enable collaboration.

### Mac

```bash
$ brew tap Oxen-AI/oxen-server
$ brew install oxen-server
```

### Docker

First, download the Docker image based on the host architecture.

For x86-64
```bash
$ wget https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen/releases/latest/download/oxen-server-docker-x86_64.tar
```

For ARM64
```bash
$ wget https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen/releases/latest/download/oxen-server-docker-arm64.tar
```

Then, load the image into Docker.
```bash
docker load < oxen-server-docker-*.tar
```

Finally, run a new container.
```bash
docker run -d -v /var/oxen/data:/var/oxen/data -p 80:3001 oxen/oxen-server:latest
```

### Linux
#### Ubuntu
We provide .deb packages that can be installed directly on Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu.

First, download the release for your system's architecture.

For x86-64
```bash
$ wget https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen/releases/latest/download/oxen-server-linux-x86_64.deb
```

For ARM64
```bash
$ wget https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen/releases/latest/download/oxen-server-linux-arm64.deb
```

Then run
```bash
$ sudo dpkg -i oxen-server-linux-*.deb
```

#### Other distributions
First, download the release for your system's architecture.

For x86-64
```bash
$ wget https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen/releases/latest/download/oxen-server-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

For ARM64
```bash
$ wget https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen/releases/latest/download/oxen-server-linux-arm64.tar.gz
```

```bash
$ tar -xzvf oxen-server-linux-*.tar.gz
$ chmod +x oxen-server
$ mv oxen-server /usr/local/bin
```

### Windows
We provide Windows binaries as a .exe.

```bash
$ wget https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen/releases/latest/download/oxen-server-windows-x86_64.exe.zip
```

To get up and running using the client and server, you can follow the [getting started docs](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/oxen).

## Building from Source

To build the command line tool from source, you can follow these steps.

1. Install rustup via the instructions at https://rustup.rs/
2. Clone the repository https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Oxen-AI/Oxen.git
    ```
3. `cd` into the cloned repository
    ```bash
    cd Oxen/oxen-rust
    ```
4. Run this command (the release flag is recommended but not necessary):
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```
5. After the build has finished, the `oxen` binary will be in `Oxen/oxen-rust/target/release` (or, if you did not use the --release flag, `Oxen/oxen-rust/target/debug`).

    Now, to make it usable from a terminal window, you have the option to add it to create a symlink or to add it to your `PATH`.
6. To add oxen to your `PATH`:

    Add this line to your `.bashrc` (or equivalent, e.g. `.zshrc`)
    ```bash
    export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/Oxen/oxen-rust/target/release"
    ```
7. Alternatively, to create a symlink, run the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo ln -s /path/to/Oxen/oxen-rust/target/release/oxen /usr/local/bin/oxen
    ```
    Note that if you did not use the `--release` flag when building Oxen, you will have to change the path.
