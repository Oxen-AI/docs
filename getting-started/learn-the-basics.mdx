Oxen makes versioning your datasets as easy as versioning your code. You can install through homebrew or pip or from our [releases page](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen/releases).

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
brew tap Oxen-AI/oxen
brew install oxen
```

```bash Python
pip install oxenai
```

</CodeGroup>

## Clone Dataset

Clone your first Oxen repository from the [OxenHub](https://oxen.ai/explore).

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox
```

```python Python
import oxen

# Clone the repository
repo = oxen.clone("ox/CatDogBBox")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Initialize User

Each change you make will be associated with a name and email. Set them before you get started so you know who changed what. The user data is saved by default in `~/.config/oxen/user_config.toml`.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen config --name "Bessie Oxington" --email "bessie@yourcomany.com"
```

```python Python
from oxen.user import config_user
config_user("Bessie Oxington", "bessie@oxen.ai")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Create Repository

Initialize your first Oxen repository, and commit the first version of your data.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
# Initialize the repository
oxen init
# Write data to a file
printf '%s\n' 'name,age' 'bob,12' 'jane,13' > people.csv
# Stage the data for commit
oxen add people.csv
# Commit the changes with a message
oxen commit -m "Adding my data"
```

```python Python
import os
from oxen import Repo

# Instantiate a Repo object and create the repo directory
repo = Repo("/path/to/data", mkdir=True)
# Initialize the repository
repo.init()
# Write data to a file
data_path = os.path.join(repo.path, "people.csv")
with open(data_path, "w") as f:
    f.write("name,age\nbob,12\njane,13")
# Stage the data for commit
repo.add(data_path)
# Commit the changes with a message
repo.commit("Adding my data")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Version Your Data

Once your data has been committed, you can always return to that version.

Confidently overwrite the file, move the file, delete the file, it doesn't matter. Oxen will always have a copy of the data at the time of the previous commit.

## Create Branch

It is good practice to create a new branch for changes you make to your data. This will allow you to easily compare the parallel versions of your data over time.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
# Checkout a branch named `modify-data`
oxen checkout -b modify-data
# Overwrite data in existing file
printf '%s\n' 'name,age' 'bob,12' 'jane,13' 'joe,14' > people.csv
```

```python Python
import os
from oxen import Repo

repo = Repo("/path/to/data")
# Create a new branch called `modify-data`
repo.checkout("modify-data", create=True)
# Overwrite data in existing file
data_path = os.path.join(repo.path, "people.csv")
with open(data_path, "w") as f:
    f.write("name,age\nbob,12\njane,13\njoe,14")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Delete Branch

Once finished with a branch, you can delete it.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
# Checkout main branch locally
oxen checkout main
# Delete 'other_branch' locally
oxen branch -d new_branch # may need -D if branch is not merged into main
# Delete branch in remote repo
oxen push origin --delete new_branch
```

```python Python
import os
from oxen import Repo

# Instantiate a Repo object
repo = Repo("/path/to/data")
# Checkout the main branch
repo.checkout("main")
# Delete new_branch
repo.branch('new_branch', delete=True)
# Delete remote branch
repo.push('origin', 'new_branch', delete=True)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Diff Changes

View the change you made with the `oxen diff` command. This will show you the changes you made to your data since the last commit.

```bash CLI
oxen diff image_classification_data.csv
```

```
Column changes:
   + label (str)

Row changes:
   Œî 1 (modified)
   + 3 (added)
   - 2 (removed)

shape: (6, 7)
+-------------+-----+-----+-------+--------+-------------+-------------------+
| file        | x   | y   | width | height | label.right | .oxen.diff.status |
| ---         | --- | --- | ---   | ---    | ---         | ---               |
| str         | i64 | i64 | i64   | i64    | str         | str               |
+-------------+-----+-----+-------+--------+-------------+-------------------+
| image_0.jpg | 0   | 0   | 10    | 10     | cat         | modified          |
| image_1.jpg | 1   | 2   | 10    | 20     | null        | removed           |
| image_1.jpg | 200 | 100 | 10    | 20     | dog         | added             |
| image_2.jpg | 4   | 10  | 20    | 20     | null        | removed           |
| image_3.jpg | 4   | 10  | 20    | 20     | dog         | added             |
| image_4.jpg | 10  | 10  | 10    | 10     | dog         | added             |
+-------------+-----+-----+-------+--------+-------------+-------------------+
```

Once you [push](#push-data) you changes to [OxenHub](https://oxen.ai), you can view the changes you made in your commit history.

<p align="center">
    <img src="/images/diff.jpg" alt="oxen cli demo" />
</p>

The diff command line tool is more powerful than it looks on the surface. Oxen has the ability to diff files of many formats, and the ability to specify keys are targets in tabular diffs to make it easier to see what changed.

For advanced usage, check out the [full diff documentation](/concepts/diffs).

## Restore Changes

If you are not happy with the changes you made to your data, you can restore them to the previous commit with the `oxen restore` command.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen restore people.csv
```

```python Python
# TODO: implement python wrapper
```

</CodeGroup>

## Commit Changes

Once you are happy with the changes you have made to your data, you can commit them to the repository with a new message.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen add people.csv
oxen commit -m "Adding Joe to the dataset"
```

```python Python
from oxen import Repo

repo = Repo("/path/to/data")
# Stage the data for commit
data_path = os.path.join(repo.path, "people.csv")
repo.add(data_path)
# Commit the changes with a message
repo.commit("Adding Joe to the dataset")
```

</CodeGroup>

## View History

To see the commit history of your repository, you can use the `oxen log` command.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen log
```

```python Python
from oxen import Repo

# Instantiate a Repo object
repo = Repo("/path/to/data")
# Get the commit history
commits = repo.log()
```

</CodeGroup>

## Checkout Main Branch

Once you are done making changes to your data, you can return to the main branch with the `oxen checkout` command.

Never fear, the file now has now been reverted to the inital commit again, but your changes will be saved in the branch you created.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen checkout main
```

```python Python
from oxen import Repo

# Instantiate a Repo object
repo = Repo("/path/to/data")
# Checkout the main branch
repo.checkout("main")
```

</CodeGroup>

## List Branches

To see the branches in your repository, you can use the `oxen branch` command.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen branch
```

```python Python
from oxen import Repo

# Instantiate a Repo object
repo = Repo("/path/to/data")
# Get the branches
print(repo.branches())
```

</CodeGroup>

## Push Data

Once your data has been committed locally, you can sync it to the OxenHub.

OxenHub is a free service that allows you to collaborate on your data in the cloud. You can create a free account at [https://oxen.ai](https://oxen.ai).

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
# Go create repo at https://oxen.ai
# ...
oxen config --set-remote origin https://hub.oxen.ai/<namespace>/<repo_name>
oxen config --auth hub.oxen.ai <your_auth_token>
oxen push origin main
# to push your other branch simply change the branch name from `main` to `modify-data`
```

```python Python
# Go create repo at https://oxen.ai
# ...
# Set where to push the data to (replace <namespace> and <repo_name> with your remote)
repo.set_remote("origin", "https://hub.oxen.ai/<namespace>/<repo_name>")
# Set your auth token (defaults to hub.oxen.ai host)
oxen.auth.config_auth("YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN")
# Push the changes to the remote
repo.push()
```

</CodeGroup>

## Clone Data

Clone your data faster than ever before. Oxen has been optimized to the core to make pulling large datasets as fast as possible.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox
```

```python Python
from oxen import Repo

# Clone the repository
repo = Repo("/path/to/dst")
repo = Repo.clone("https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Pull Changes

Only pull the changes you need. Oxen will only pull the files that have changed since the last time you pulled.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen pull origin main
```

```python Python
from oxen import Repo
repo = Repo("/path/to/repo")
repo.pull()
```

</CodeGroup>

## Download Individual Files

With Oxen you do not need to download the entire dataset to your local machine. You can download only the subset of files or directories you need.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen clone http://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox --shallow
cd CatDogBBox
oxen remote download annotations/test.csv
```

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo
repo = RemoteRepo("http://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox")
repo.download("annotations/test.csv")
```

```bash cURL
# URL Format: https://hub.oxen.ai/api/repos/:namespace/:repo_name/file/:revision/:path
# :revision can be a branch name or commit hash
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    https://hub.oxen.ai/api/repos/ox/CatDogBBox/file/main/annotations/test.csv \
    -o ~/Downloads/test.csv
```

</CodeGroup>
