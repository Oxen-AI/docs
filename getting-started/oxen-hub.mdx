## Your Repositories

From your home page, you can view your repositories and create a new repository.

## Setup Authorization

You will notice on the side panel you have access to your API Key. In order to push data to your repository you will need to copy this key and set it up in your user config. This saves your key in `~/.oxen/user_config.toml` with one key per host if you ever need to push to multiple hosts.

```bash
oxen config --auth hub.oxen.ai YOUR_API_KEY
```

```bash
cat ~/.oxen/user_config.toml
```

## Create Remote Repository

Pick a name and give your repository a description. Repositories can be public for anyone to view, or private just for you and your company.

## Push your data

Once you have created a repository, you will see a URL you can push your data to in the format `https://hub.oxen.ai/<username>/<repo_name>`

From the data repository that you [created above](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/oxen-release#create-repository) you can simply add the remote and push.

```bash
oxen config --set-remote origin https://hub.oxen.ai/<username>/<repo_name>
```

```bash
oxen push origin main
```

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats! You should now be able to see your data in the hub.

You can add collaborators from the web interface and start building out your data pipeline.
