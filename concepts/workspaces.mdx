Oxen makes it feel like your dataset is local, even when it is not downloaded to the machine you are on.

# Connecting to a Remote Repository

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo("datasets/dolly-15k-rlhf")
```

</CodeGroup>

# File Exploration

To see the files in the remote repository you can use `ls`.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo("datasets/dolly-15k-rlhf")
print(repo.ls())
```

</CodeGroup>

To view a specific directory you can use `oxen remote ls <directory>`. Note: the directories are paginated so you will need to use the `--page` flag to view the next page of results. The python library also gives access to pagination parameters.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen remote ls images/
```

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo("datasets/dolly-15k-rlhf")
images_results = repo.ls("images", page_num=1, page_size=10)
print(images_results)
print(images_results.total_pages)
print(images_results.page_number)
print(images_results.total_entries)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Downloading Data

You can even download subsets of the data in the event you do not need the entire data repository for your job. You may even just want to do some intial exploration of the data before you decide to clone the entire repository.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen remote download images/000000002754.jpg
```

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo
repo = RemoteRepo("datasets/dolly-15k-rlhf")
repo.download("images/000000002754.jpg")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Exploring Data Frames

Data Frames can be explored straight from the command line or downloaded into your local python environment to do additional exploration. The same parameters for exploring local data frames apply to remote data frames, and can be found in the [data frame documentation](/concepts/data-frames).

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
# Note that the df is not downloaded locally
oxen remote df annotations/train.csv
```

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo
import pandas as pd

# Connect to the remote repo
repo = RemoteRepo("datasets/dolly-15k-rlhf")
# Downloads the file locally
repo.download("annotations/train.csv")
# Use whatever library you want to explore the data
df = pd.read_csv("annotations/train.csv")
print(df.head())
```

</CodeGroup>

You can think of the remaining `oxen remote` subcommands similar to the standard `oxen` but in your remote workspace. For example, you can run `oxen remote status` to see the status of your remote workspace.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen remote status
```

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo("datasets/dolly-15k-rlhf")
status = repo.status()
print(status.added_files())
```

</CodeGroup>

## Adding Files

When adding data, it is always a good idea to create a branch for the changes you are about to make. This will allow you to make changes without affecting the default branch.

## Creating a Branch

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen checkout -b add-images
oxen push origin add-images
```

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo("datasets/dolly-15k-rlhf")
# Create the branch on the remote
repo.create_branch("add-images")
# Make sure you are pointing to this branch
repo.checkout("add-images")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Staging Files

To add raw files to the remote workspace you can use `oxen remote add <file>`. This will add the file to the remote workspace, but will not commit the changes.

Each user has their own independent remote workspace. This means that you can add files to your remote workspace without affecting other users on the branch, and that when you commit, it will only commit the subset of data within your remote staging area.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen remote add image.png
oxen remote status
```

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo("datasets/dolly-15k-rlhf")
repo.add("/path/to/image.png")
status = repo.status()
print(status.added_files())
```

</CodeGroup>

## Removing Remote Staged Files

If you accidentally add file from the remote workspace and want to remove it, no worries, you can unstage it with `oxen remote rm --staged`. 

```bash
$ oxen remote rm --staged my-images/image.jpg
```

## Commit Staged Files

When you are confident in the changes you have made, you can commit the changes to the remote workspace. This will create a new commit on the remote branch.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen remote commit -m "adding an image"
```

```python Python
# ... assumming you have data added to your remote workspace
repo.commit("adding an image")
```

</CodeGroup>

🎉 You have now committed data to the remote branch without cloning the full repo.

Note: If the remote branch cannot be merged cleanly, the remote commit will fail, and you will have to resolve the merge conflicts with some more advanced commands which we will cover later.

## Remote Log

To see a list of remote commits on the branch you can use `remote log`. Your latest commit will be at the top of this list.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen remote log
```

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo("datasets/dolly-15k-rlhf")
print(repo.log())
```

</CodeGroup>

## Appending To Data Frames

Commonly, you will want to tie some sort of annotation to your files. For example, you might want to label an image with a bounding box, or a video with a bounding box and a class label.

Oxen has native support for extending and managing structured Data Frames in the form of csv, jsonl, or parquet files. To interact with these files remotely you can use the `oxen remote df` command.

We will be focusing on adding data to these files, but you can also use the `oxen remote df` command to view the contents of a DataFrame with all the same parameters locally. To learn more about the `oxen remote df` command, check out the [data frame documentation](/concepts/data-frames).

TODO: add python documentation

Say you want to add a bounding box annotation to this dataframe without cloning it locally. You can use the `--add-row` flag on the `oxen remote df` command to remotely stage a row on the DataFrame.


```bash
oxen remote df annotations/train.csv --add-row "my-images/image.jpg,dog,100,100,200,200"
```

```bash
shape: (1, 7)
+----------------------------------+---------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------┐
| _id                              ┆ file                ┆ label ┆ min_x ┆ min_y ┆ width ┆ height |
| ---                              ┆ ---                 ┆ ---   ┆ ---   ┆ ---   ┆ ---   ┆ ---    |
| str                              ┆ str                 ┆ str   ┆ f64   ┆ f64   ┆ f64   ┆ f64    |
+----------------------------------+---------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+

+----------------------------------+---------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+
```

This returns a unique ID for the row that we can use as a handle to interact with the specific row in the remote workspace. To list the added rows on the dataframe you can use the `oxen remote diff` command.

```bash
oxen remote diff annotations/train.csv
```

```bash

| ---                              ┆ ---                  ┆ ---   ┆ ---   ┆ ---   ┆ ---   ┆ ---    |

```

If you want to delete a staged row, you can delete it with the `--delete-row` flag and the value in the `_id` column.

```bash
oxen remote df annotations/train.csv --delete-row 822ac1facbd79444f1f33a2a0b2f909d
```

To clear all staged rows, you can use the `restore` subcommand to restore the file.

```bash
oxen remote restore --staged annotations/train.csv
```

Once you have a set of rows you want to commit on your data frame, simply call `oxen remote commit` again.

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
oxen remote commit -m "adding an image"
```

```python Python
# ... assumming you have data added to your remote workspace
repo.commit("adding an image")
```
