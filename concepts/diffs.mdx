If you want to see the differences between your file and the conflicting file, you can use the `oxen diff` command.

Oxen knows how to compare text files as well as [tabular data](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/oxen-release/blob/main/DataFrames.md) between commits. Currently, you must specify the specific path to the file you want to compare the changes.

If the file is tabular data `oxen diff` will show you the rows that were added or removed.

First use the `oxen df` command to add a row to the data frame.

```bash
oxen df annotations/data.csv --add-row 'images/my_cat.jpg,cat,0,0,0,0' -o annotations/data.csv
```

Then use the `oxen diff` command to see the changes.

```bash
oxen diff annotations/data.csv 
``` 

![diff add row](/images/diff-added-row.png)

If the tabular data schema has changed `oxen diff` will flag and show you the columns that were added.

Add a new column to the data frame.

```bash
oxen df annotations/data.csv --add-col 'is_fluffy:unknown:str' -o annotations/data.csv
```

Then use the `oxen diff` command to see the changes.

```bash
oxen diff annotations/data.csv
```

![diff add col](/images/diff-added-col.png)

If the file is any other type of text data, it will simply show you the added and removed lines.

```bash
oxen diff path/to/file.txt
```

```
