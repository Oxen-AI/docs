Oxen.ai has built in tools to help you find differences in your datasets. It is as simple as running the `oxen diff` command with the path to your datasets.

```bash
oxen diff dataset1.csv dataset2.csv -o diff.csv
```

```bash
Column changes:
   + label (str)

Row changes:
   Δ 1 (modified)
   + 3 (added)
   - 2 (removed)

shape: (6, 7)
+-------------+-----+-----+-------+--------+-------------+-------------------+

Under the hood Oxen.ai is using a combination of hashing and diffing algorithms to find the differences in your datasets. This allows you to quickly find changes in your datasets, whether they are rows, columns, or individual cells. Oxen's diff tool tries to strike a balance between being easy to use and being powerful enough to handle complex datasets.

# Tools for Data Diffs

The tooling is available through the 🖥️ command line, 🦀 rust library, 🐍 python library, as well as the 🌎 web interface. This guide will focus on the command line tooling, but the same principles apply to the other interfaces.

We will build up from simple examples to more complex ones. Starting from adding and removing rows, to modifying rows, to detecting schema changes, and finally providing specific target fields you are interested in.

# Let's Build a Dataset

In order to demonstrate how to use the `oxen diff` command, we will need a dataset to work with. Imagine we are collecting a dataset for fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM). This dataset will have a set of `prompts` and a `category` that they belong to.

Create a new file called `dataset.csv` and add the following data to it.

```bash
prompt,category
What is the capital of France?,geography
What is 2+10?,math
What is the capital of Germany?,geography
What is the best python library for http requests?,programming
Tell me a story about an ox.,story
```

If you are not familiar with the `oxen df` command it is a handy tool to manipulate and inspect tabular data. You can use it with any CSV, TSV, Parquet, or line delimited JSON file.

```bash
oxen df dataset.csv
```

```bash
shape: (5, 2)
+-----------------------------------+-------------+
| prompt                            | category    |
| ---                               | ---         |
| str                               | str         |
+-----------------------------------+-------------+
| What is the capital of France?    | geography   |
| What is 2+10?                     | math        |
| What is the capital of Germany?   | geography   |
| What is the best python library … | programming |
| Tell me a story about an ox.      | story       |
+-----------------------------------+-------------+
```

In order to return to this initial version of the data at any point, let's add and commit it to a local Oxen repository.

```bash
oxen init
oxen add dataset.csv
oxen commit -m "Initial dataset"
```

## Adding Rows

Let's start with a completely additive workflow as if we are collecting a large datasets of prompts. Add a row to the dataset by simply appending to the file.

```bash
echo "20*20,math" >> dataset.csv
```

If you want to see the changes between the current version of your file and the previous version, you can use the `oxen diff` command. If you only specify one file, Oxen will compare the current version of the file with the last committed version.

```bash
oxen diff dataset.csv
```

```bash
Row changes:
   + 1 (added)

shape: (1, 3)
+--------+----------+-------------------+
| prompt | category | .oxen.diff.status |
| ---    | ---      | ---               |
| str    | str      | str               |
+--------+----------+-------------------+
| 20*20  | math     | added             |
+--------+----------+-------------------+
```

As you can see Oxen found the one added row and added a `.oxen.diff.status` column to the dataset to show the status of the row.

There are three possible values for the `.oxen.diff.status` column:

- `added`
- `removed`
- `modified`

## Removing Rows

Next remove the first entry of the file to see how Oxen handles deletions.

```bash
sed -i '' '2d' dataset.csv
```

(Note: the `-i ''` flag is for MacOS, if you are using Linux you can simply use `-i`.) Since the file is a CSV with a header row, you will need to remove the second row hence `2d`.

Verify that the first row was removed by using the `oxen diff` command.

```bash
oxen diff dataset.csv
```

```bash
Row changes:
   + 1 (added)
   - 1 (removed)

shape: (2, 3)
+--------------------------------+-----------+-------------------+
| prompt                         | category  | .oxen.diff.status |
| ---                            | ---       | ---               |
| str                            | str       | str               |
+--------------------------------+-----------+-------------------+
| What is the capital of France? | geography | removed           |
| 20*20                          | math      | added             |
+--------------------------------+-----------+-------------------+
```

## Modifing Rows

This is great for adding and removing rows, but what about modifying rows? Say we change the `category` of "geography" to be a more generic "trivia" category and add a new prompt to it "What is the fastest land animal?".

Edit the `datasets.csv` file to look like this:

```bash
prompt,category
What is 2+10?,math
What is the capital of Germany?,trivia
What is the best python library for http requests?,programming
Tell me a story about an ox.,story
20*20,math
What is the fastest land animal?,trivia
```

If we run the `oxen diff` command again, we will see the changes.

```bash
Row changes:
   + 3 (added)
   - 2 (removed)

shape: (5, 3)
+----------------------------------+-----------+-------------------+
| prompt                           | category  | .oxen.diff.status |
| ---                              | ---       | ---               |
| str                              | str       | str               |
+----------------------------------+-----------+-------------------+
| What is the capital of France?   | geography | removed           |
| What is the capital of Germany?  | geography | removed           |
| 20*20                            | math      | added             |
| What is the capital of Germany?  | trivia    | added             |
| What is the fastest land animal? | trivia    | added             |
+----------------------------------+-----------+-------------------+
```

You'll notice that for every row we modified we end up having +1 addition and +1 removal. This is because Oxen is treating the modified row as a new row and a removed row.

## Specifying Keys

The reason that the above example treats the modified row as a new row and a removed row is because both the `prompt` and `category` columns being considered keys under the hood. `oxen diff` hashes the combination of keys in order to find differences in the data. The default keys are all the common columns between the two datasets.

If you have a unique identifier for each row, you can use the `--keys` (or `-k`) flag to specify the column or columns that should be used as the primary keys.

```bash
oxen diff dataset.csv -k prompt
```

```bash
Row changes:
   Δ 1 (modified)
   + 2 (added)
   - 1 (removed)

shape: (4, 4)
+----------------------------------+---------------+----------------+-------------------+
| prompt                           | category.left | category.right | .oxen.diff.status |
| ---                              | ---           | ---            | ---               |
| str                              | str           | str            | str               |
+----------------------------------+---------------+----------------+-------------------+
| 20*20                            | null          | math           | added             |
| What is the capital of France?   | geography     | null           | removed           |
| What is the capital of Germany?  | geography     | trivia         | modified          |
| What is the fastest land animal? | null          | trivia         | added             |
+----------------------------------+---------------+----------------+-------------------+
```

Great! This collapsed our added and removed row into a single modified row. The category column has now been split into two columns, `category.left` and `category.right`, to show the old and new values.

Assumming these changes look good, you can add and commit the changes to your local repository.

```bash
oxen add dataset.csv
oxen commit -m "Added and removed rows"
```

## Adding Columns

Adding and removing rows is great, but what about changes to the schema itself? Instead of using the prompt as a key, let's add an `id` column to the dataset and use that as the key. Let's also add an `answer` column to the dataset, so that we can evaluate the responses.

Update your raw csv with the new columns like so:

```bash
id,prompt,answer,category
0,What is 2+10?,12,math
1,What is the capital of Germany?,Berlin,trivia
2,What is the best python library for http requests?,requests,programming
3,Tell me a story about an ox.,I am sorry I cannot do that.,story
4,20*20,400,math
5,What is the fastest land animal?,cheetah,trivia
```

Now if you run the `oxen diff` command, you will see that it automatically detects the added columns and displays the new values in `id.right` and `answer.right`.

```bash
oxen diff dataset.csv
```

```bash
Column changes:
   + id (i64)
   + answer (str)

Row changes:
   Δ 6 (modified)

shape: (6, 5)
+-----------------------------------+-------------+----------+------------------------------+-------------------+
| prompt                            | category    | id.right | answer.right                 | .oxen.diff.status |
| ---                               | ---         | ---      | ---                          | ---               |
| str                               | str         | i64      | str                          | str               |
+-----------------------------------+-------------+----------+------------------------------+-------------------+
| 20*20                             | math        | 4        | 400                          | modified          |
| What is 2+10?                     | math        | 0        | 12                           | modified          |
| What is the best python library … | programming | 2        | requests                     | modified          |
| Tell me a story about an ox.      | story       | 3        | I am sorry I cannot do that. | modified          |
| What is the capital of Germany?   | trivia      | 1        | Berlin                       | modified          |
| What is the fastest land animal?  | trivia      | 5        | cheetah                      | modified          |
+-----------------------------------+-------------+----------+------------------------------+-------------------+
```

If you are happy with the changes, you can add and commit the changes to your local repository.

```bash
oxen add dataset.csv
oxen commit -m "Added id and answer column"
```

## Specifying Targets

Now imagine you have taken this dataset and run it through an LLM with a prompt to get the responses. You have saved the results in a new file called `model_results.csv`.

```python

```

```bash
id,prompt,answer,category,response,is_correct,model,inference_time
0,What is 2+10?,12,math,12,true,model-1,0.23
1,What is the capital of Germany?,Berlin,trivia,Munich,false,model-1,0.11
2,What is the best python library for http requests?,requests,programming,requests,true,model-1,0.32
3,Tell me a story about an ox.,I am sorry I cannot do that.,story,Once upon a time,false,model-1,0.22
4,20*20,400,math,400,true,model-1,0.1
5,What is the fastest land animal?,cheetah,trivia,cheetah,true,model-1,0.4
```

This dataset has the same `id`, `prompt`, `answer`, and `category` columns as the original dataset, but it also has some additional columns such as `response`, `is_correct`, `model`, and `inference_time`.

Add and commit the model results to your local repository.

```bash
oxen add model_results.csv
oxen commit -m "Added model results"
```

Let's say you tweaked the prompt and wanted to run the dataset through the LLM again. Since you have the results versioned in your local repository, you can fearlessly overwrite the file and run the `oxen diff` command to see the differences.

Overwrite the `model_results.csv` file with the new results.

```bash
id,prompt,answer,category,response,is_correct,model,inference_time
0,What is 2+10?,12,math,12,true,model-2,0.21
1,What is the capital of Germany?,Berlin,trivia,Berlin,true,model-2,0.12
2,What is the best python library for http requests?,requests,programming,requests,true,model-2,0.31
3,Tell me a story about an ox.,I am sorry I cannot do that.,story,I am sorry I cannot do that.,true,model-2,0.23
4,20*20,400,math,400,true,model-2,0.09
5,What is the fastest land animal?,cheetah,trivia,cheetah,true,model-2,0.41
```

If we do a base diff without any flags, we will see that every row is has been marked as added and removed, since the `model` and `inference_time` columns are always different.

```bash
oxen diff model_results.csv
```

```bash
Row changes:
   + 6 (added)
   - 6 (removed)

shape: (12, 9)
+-----+----------------------------------+---------+----------+---+------------+---------+----------------+-------------------+
| id  | prompt                           | answer  | category | … | is_correct | model   | inference_time | .oxen.diff.status |

| 0   | What is 2+10?                    | 12      | math     | … | true       | model-2 | 0.21           | added             |
| 0   | What is 2+10?                    | 12      | math     | … | true       | model-1 | 0.23           | removed           |
| …   | …                                | …       | …        | … | …          | …       | …              | …                 |
| 1   | What is the capital of Germany?  | Berlin  | trivia   | … | true       | model-2 | 0.12           | added             |
| 1   | What is the capital of Germany?  | Berlin  | trivia   | … | false      | model-1 | 0.11           | removed           |
| 5   | What is the fastest land animal? | cheetah | trivia   | … | true       | model-1 | 0.4            | removed           |
| 5   | What is the fastest land animal? | cheetah | trivia   | … | true       | model-2 | 0.41           | added             |
+-----+----------------------------------+---------+----------+---+------------+---------+----------------+------------
```

This is clearly not what we want. We want to see the differences in the `response` and `is_correct` columns, and ignore the `model` and `inference_time` columns.

In combination with the `--keys` flag, you can use the `--targets` (or `-t`) flag to specify the columns you are interested in.

```bash
oxen diff model_results.csv -k id,prompt,answer -t response,is_correct
```

```bash
Row changes:
   Δ 2 (modified)

|     | Germany?       |                |                |                |                |                |               |

+-----+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+---------------+
```

This now narrows down the scope of the diff to only the `response` and `is_correct` columns. We can see that the new model has a different response for the prompt "What is the capital of Germany?" and the response for "Tell me a story about an ox.". This allows us to quickly narrow down the responses that model 1 and model 2 disagree on, and which ones are correct.

## Compare

The next logical step for this dataset would be to run it through a model and add some additional fields such as `response`, `is_correct`, `model` and `inference_time`. The problem is this adds a lot of noise to the diff since the `model` and `inference_time` columns will always be different.

To see this in action, imagine you ran the dataset through `model-1` and `model-2` and saved the results in two separate files.

model-1.csv

```bash
id,prompt,answer,category,response,is_correct,model,inference_time
0,What is 2+10?,12,math,12,true,model-1,0.23
1,What is the capital of Germany?,Berlin,trivia,Munich,false,model-1,0.11
2,What is the best python library for http requests?,requests,programming,requests,true,model-1,0.32
3,Tell me a story about an ox.,I am sorry I cannot do that.,story,Once upon a time,false,model-1,0.22
4,20*20,400,math,400,true,model-1,0.1
5,What is the fastest land animal?,cheetah,trivia,cheetah,true,model-1,0.4
```

model-2.csv

```bash

Not only can you use `oxen diff` to compare this history of a single file, but you can use it to compare two different files.

```bash
oxen diff model-1.csv model-2.csv
```

The problem is the default diff considers every row to be changed since we are hashing the entire row, and each row has different values for `model` and `inference_time` (as well as sometimes `response` and `is_correct`).

What we really want to figure out is which rows have different responses and if the responses are correct or not. We can use a combination of the `--keys` and `--targets` flags to target specific columns.

```bash
oxen diff model-1.csv model-2.csv -k id,prompt,answer -t response,is_correct
```

```bash
Row changes:

```

In this case we are using the `id`, `prompt`, and `answer` columns as the keys and the `response` and `is_correct` columns as the targets. This allows us to quickly narrow down the responses that model 1 and model 2 disagree on, and which ones are correct.
