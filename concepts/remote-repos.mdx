title: 'Remote Repositories'
description: 'After you push your data to an [oxen-server](/getting-started/oxen-server), you can use remote repositories to interact with your data.'

Oxen makes it feel like your dataset is local, even when it is not downloaded to the machine you are on.

# Connecting to a Remote Repository

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo("datasets/dolly-15k-rlhf")
```

</CodeGroup>

# File Exploration

To see the files in the remote repository you can use `ls`.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo("ox/CatDogBBox")
print(repo.ls())
```

</CodeGroup>

To view a specific directory you can pass the directory name to the `ls` method. 

Note: the directories are paginated so you will need to use the `page_num` parameter to view the next page of results.
There are also `total_pages`, `page_number`, and `total_entries` attributes that give you information about the pagination.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo("ox/CatDogBBox")
images_results = repo.ls("images", page_num=1, page_size=10)
print(images_results)
print(images_results.total_pages)
print(images_results.page_number)
print(images_results.total_entries)
```

</CodeGroup>

# Downloading Data

You can download subsets of the data if you do not need the entire data repository for your job.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo
repo = RemoteRepo("ox/CatDogBBox")
repo.download("images/000000002754.jpg")
```

```bash CLI
oxen download ox/CatDogBBox images/000000002754.jpg
```

</CodeGroup>

# Checkout a Branch

If you have a data on a separate branch that you want to view you can checkout a branch by passing the branch name to the `checkout` method.

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo
repo = RemoteRepo("ox/CatDogBBox")
repo.checkout("my-branch-name")
print(repo.ls())
```

# Create a New Branch

The `checkout` method also allows you to create a new branch if the branch does not exist.

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo
repo = RemoteRepo("ox/CatDogBBox")
repo.checkout("my-new-branch-name", create=True)
print(repo.ls())
```

# View Branches

To see all the branches in the remote repository you can use the `branches` method.

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo
repo = RemoteRepo("ox/CatDogBBox")
print(repo.branches())
```

# Create a RemoteRepo

You may want to start with an empty remote repository and add your data later.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo.create("my-user/my-repo-name")
```

```bash CLI
oxen create-remote --name my-user/my-repo-name
```

</CodeGroup>

By default we add a `README.md` file to the repository with an initial commit. If you want to create an empty repository without adding a `README.md` you can pass `empty=True` to the `create` method.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo.create("my-user/my-repo-name", empty=True)
```

```bash CLI
oxen create-remote --name my-user/my-repo-name --empty
```

</CodeGroup>

The reason you may want to start with an empty repository is if you already started a local repository and want to push it to the remote repository. This local repository already has a commit history. When pushing to a remote, commit histories must match. Hence we need to start with an empty remote repository without any commits if we want to push a local repository with a commit history.

# Remote URL

Remote repositories are identified by a remote URL. This is the URL that you can use to clone the repository.

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo.create("my-user/my-repo-name", empty=True)
print(repo.url())
```

You can use this URL to clone the repository.

```bash Python
# Local Repository
from oxen import Repo
from oxen import RemoteRepo

remote_repo = RemoteRepo.create("my-user/my-repo-name", empty=True)
repo_url = remote_repo.url()

local_repo = Repo("/path/to/local/repo")
local_repo.clone(repo_url)
```

Or you can set the remote of a local repository to the remote repository.

```bash Python
from oxen import Repo
from oxen import RemoteRepo

remote_repo = RemoteRepo.create("my-user/my-repo-name", empty=True)
repo_url = remote_repo.url()

local_repo = Repo("/path/to/local/repo")
remote_repo.set_remote("origin", remote_repo.url())
```
