## Workspace Objects

```python
class Workspace()
```

The Workspace class allows you to interact with an Oxen workspace
without downloading the data locally.

Workspaces can be created off a branch and is tied to the commit id of the branch
at the time of creation.

You can commit a Workspace back to the same branch if the branch has not
advanced, otherwise you will have to commit to a new branch and merge.

## Examples

### Adding Files to a Workspace

Create a workspace from a branch.

```python
from oxen import RemoteRepo
from oxen import Workspace

# Connect to the remote repo
repo = RemoteRepo("ox/CatDogBBox")

# Create the workspace
workspace = Workspace(repo, "my-branch")

# Add a file to the workspace
workspace.add("my-image.png")

# Print the status of the workspace
status = workspace.status()
print(status.added_files())

# Commit the workspace
workspace.commit("Adding my image to the workspace.")
```
