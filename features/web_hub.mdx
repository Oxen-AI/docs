## Setup Authorization

You will notice on the side panel you have access to your API Key. In order to push data to your repository you will need to copy this key and set it up in your user config. This saves your key in `~/.config/oxen/user_config.toml` with one key per host if you ever need to push to multiple hosts.

```bash
oxen config --auth hub.oxen.ai YOUR_API_KEY
```

```bash
cat ~/.config/oxen/user_config.toml
```

## Create Remote Repository

Pick a name and give your repository a description. Repositories can be public for anyone to view, or private just for you and your company.

## Push your data

Once you have created a repository, you will see a URL you can push your data to in the format `https://hub.oxen.ai/<username>/<repo_name>`

From the data repository that you [created above](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/oxen-release#create-repository) you can simply add the remote and push.

```bash
oxen config --set-remote origin https://hub.oxen.ai/<username>/<repo_name>
```

```bash
oxen push origin main
```

You will now be able to see your data in the hub.

## Add Collaborators

Now you can add collaborators from the web interface to share your work with your team. Click the + next to "Contributors" on the bottom right of your repo and you will find the contributors page:
