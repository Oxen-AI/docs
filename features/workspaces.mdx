title: 'ðŸŒ² Optimizing Data Transfer'
description: 'Oxen allows you to interact with your data without having to download the entire dataset locally.'

There are many times when you only need a small subset of a dataset. For example, you may only want to run a model on a subset of images, kick off an evaluation, or run a query on a small subset of rows.

Oxen has two main ways of slicing, dicing and filtering your data.

1) **Local Subtrees** - A local subtree allows you to clone a subset of the data in your repository.
2) **Remote Workspaces** - A remote workspace is a remote branch that allows you to interact with your data all server side, no files are downloaded locally.

This is a quickstart guide to show you some different workflows you can use to interact with your repository.

An Oxen Workspace is a convenient construct for adding data. Conceptually you can think of a workspace a special type of branch where you can stage remote changes before committing them. Under the hood, a workspace is tied to a commit id. This means whatever changes you make will always be with respect to the commit you created the workspace off of.

# Instantiating a Workspace

A workspace is created off of a `RemoteRepo` and a branch name. The branch name is just a convenience for the user to create a workspace on the underlying commit id.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo
from oxen import Workspace

repo = RemoteRepo("ox/CatDogBBox")
workspace = Workspace(repo, "add-images")
```

```bash CLI
oxen workspace create -w my-workspace-name -b add-images
```

</CodeGroup>

If no branch name is provided, the workspace will be created off of the default branch (usually `main`).

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo
from oxen import Workspace

repo = RemoteRepo("ox/CatDogBBox")
workspace = Workspace(repo)
```

```bash CLI
oxen workspace create -w my-workspace-name
```

</CodeGroup>

# Adding Files

When adding data, it is always a good idea to create a branch for the changes you are about to make. This will allow you to commit changes without affecting the default branch.

## Creating a Branch

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo("ox/CatDogBBox")
# Create the branch on the remote
repo.create_branch("add-images")
# Make sure you are pointing to this branch
repo.checkout("add-images")
```

```bash CLI
oxen checkout -b add-images
oxen push origin add-images
```

</CodeGroup>

## Uploading Files

Workspaces allow you to upload files without immediately committing them. Think of this as a staging area where you can upload the data, and then batch commit when you are ready.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo
from oxen import Workspace

repo = RemoteRepo("ox/CatDogBBox")
workspace = Workspace(repo, "add-images")
workspace.add("/path/to/image.png")
status = workspace.status()
print(status.added_files())
```

```bash CLI
oxen workspace add image.png -w my-workspace-id
oxen workspace status -w my-workspace-id
```

</CodeGroup>

## Removing Uploaded Files

If you accidentally add file from the remote workspace and want to remove it, no worries, you can unstage it with `oxen remote rm --staged`.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo
from oxen import Workspace

repo = RemoteRepo("ox/CatDogBBox")
workspace = Workspace(repo, "add-images")
workspace.rm("image.jpg")
status = workspace.status()
print(status.added_files())
```

```bash
oxen workspace rm image.jpg -w my-workspace-id
```

</CodeGroup>

## Commit Changes

When you are confident in the changes you have made, you can commit the changes to the remote workspace. This will create a new commit on the remote branch.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from oxen import RemoteRepo
from oxen import Workspace

repo = RemoteRepo("ox/CatDogBBox")
workspace = Workspace(repo, "add-images")
workspace.commit("adding an image", "add-images")
```

```bash CLI
oxen workspace commit -m "adding an image" -w my-workspace-id -b add-images
```

</CodeGroup>

ðŸŽ‰ You have now committed data to the remote branch without cloning the full repo.

Note: If the remote branch cannot be merged cleanly, the remote commit will fail, and you will have to resolve the merge conflicts with some more advanced commands which we will cover later.
