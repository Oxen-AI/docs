## Upload Your Dataset

Open the dataset you want to work with. You can find an example dataset on our [explore page](https://www.oxen.ai/explore) or if you want to follow along with the example, you can clone the [Thinking LLMs dataset](https://www.oxen.ai/ox/Thinking-LLMs) we are using.

```bash
oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/Thinking-LLMs --all
oxen create-remote --name "your-username/Thinking-LLMs"
oxen config --set-remote origin "your-username/Thinking-LLMs"
oxen push origin main
```

## Ask any Question!

Go ahead and ask any questions you have! The SQL will automatically generate and apply to the view of your data.

In this case, we are looking for the distribution of the type of questions asked to the LLM:

```
what is the distribution in the category column sort by count
```

You can also run queries in different datasets such as *"What was the most common word asked for in the prompt columns?"* or *"How many rows have the word "code" in the prompt column?"*

## Edit, Augment, or Delete SQL Query

If you would like to change or augment your SQL query, simply click on the "show SQL" button on the right of the screen. If you would like to delete the SQL query, just click the "Remove query" button to the left of the edit SQL button.
