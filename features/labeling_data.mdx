## Upload Your Dataset

Navigate to the repository you want to work with, or create a new one. If you need starter data, you can find example datasets on our [explore page](https://www.oxen.ai/explore). To follow along with the example, you can clone the [Synthetic Political Spam Dataset](https://www.oxen.ai/Laurence/political-spam) we are using.

```bash
oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/Laurence/political-spam --all
oxen create-remote --name "your-username/political-spam"
oxen config --set-remote origin "your-username/political-spam"
oxen push origin main
```

To edit your rows, there are two actions you can take:
