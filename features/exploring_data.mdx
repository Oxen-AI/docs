## Upload Your Dataset

Click the file your repository to open the dataset you want to work with. You can find an example dataset on our [explore page](https://www.oxen.ai/explore). Or if you want to follow along with this example, download the [Thinking LLMs](https://www.oxen.ai/ox/Thinking-LLMs) dataset. Upload the dataset to your own repository so that you can version and edit it.

## Query Your Dataset

To query your dataset, write a question in the search bar. This will automatically generate a SQL query and apply it to the view of your data.


For example, you can look at the distribution of question types by asking:

```
What are all the categories sorted by count?
```

If the query engine makes a mistake, no worries! You can edit the SQL query to get the results you want.

## Edit the SQL Query

If you would like to change or augment your SQL query, simply click on the "show SQL" button on the right of the screen. If you would like to delete the SQL query, just click the "Remove query" button to the left of the edit SQL button.

Congratulations! You've just seen how easy it is to query your datasets in Oxen.ai. Queries can also be used while editing your dataset, for example if you want to filter the data as you are labeling. Checkout our [labeling workflows](/features/labeling_data) for more examples!
