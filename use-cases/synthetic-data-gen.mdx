title: 'ðŸ¤– Synthetic Data Gen'
description: '**Synthetic Data Generation** is using a model to generate data. Instead of just using naturally collected data, you can use a model to augment your data by adding examples, columns, etc. or even generate a completely new dataset.'
---


A couple of examples would be:
>
>You use a model to generate a dataset of 1000 invoices with random amounts and dates. This data can then be used for training a model to predict the total amount of an invoice.
>
>You generate a bunch of images with [GPT-4o](https://www.oxen.ai/explore/models#openai) and then ask the model to describe the images in detail. You then use the synthetic labeled image data to train another model to generate images.

In this tutorial, we will show you how we created a dataset of different roles in a company, a product they would use, and then a question and response about the product. This can be used for customer support, a chatbot, etc.
>
We used [Llama 3.1 70B](https://www.oxen.ai/explore/models#fireworks) and [Hermes 3 70B](https://www.oxen.ai/explore/models#lambda) to compare the quality of the synthetic data. Check out the [Models Page](https://www.oxen.ai/explore/models) to try different models.

## Upload Your Dataset

[Push the dataset](/getting-started/learn-the-basics#create-repository) you want to work with, clone the [Synthetic Persona Customer Support Dataset](https://www.oxen.ai/datasets/Synthetic-Persona-Customer-Support) we generated, or you can find a dataset on our [explore page](https://www.oxen.ai/explore).


```bash

oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/Synthetic-Persona-Customer-Support --all
export OXEN_USERNAME="your-username" # NOTE: Replace with your username
oxen create-remote --name "$OXEN_USERNAME/Synthetic-Persona-Customer-Support"
oxen config --set-remote origin "$OXEN_USERNAME/Synthetic-Persona-Customer-Support"
oxen push origin main
```

## Create a Model Evaluation

Open the file you want to embed and press the glowing button with the rocket ðŸš€ on it at the top right of the screen.

## First Evaluation Run

You will now find Oxen's model evaluation feature. This is where you can choose the evaluation type, a model, and name the output column.

We're starting with Meta's [Llama 3.1 70B](https://www.oxen.ai/explore/models#fireworks) and generating a product for each role.
We are passing the roles (and uuid to see if it has an effect on the output) in the prompt.
Give the evaluation a name and run a quick sample on a few rows to see if the prompt works.

<img
  className="block"
  src="/images/synthetic_data_prompt_page.png"
  alt="creating the product for each role"
/>
The product generation prompt:
```bash

{uuid} Imagine you are a {role} what is the most necessary software product you need for your job?
Just answer with the product. No extra words or descriptions.
```

## Select File Destination

After tweaking your prompt and getting a sample you like, click "Next" to decide the destination of the finished evaluation.
Decide the target branch, target path, and if you would like to commit instantly or after reviewing the outcome. Once you've decided, click "Run Evaluation".

  alt="Eval commit page"
/>

## Monitor Your Evaluation

Feel free to grab a coffee, close the tab, or do something else while the evaluation is running. Your trusty Oxen Herd will be running in the background.
>
While the evaluation is running you will see a progress bar showing how many rows have been completed, an update of how many tokens are being used, and how expensive the run is so far.

  alt="Eval processing bar"
/>



## Repeat, Repeat, Repeat


After generating the product, we then generated a question and response about each product with the same process. 
Just click "View file at commit" to see the updated dataset.

<img
  className="block"
  src="/images/synth_file_at_commit.png"
  alt="Finished file location"
/>

Then repeat the whole process for the question and response generation with these prompts:
```bash

{uuid} Imagine you are {role}, what is a question you would ask about {product}?
Answer with only the question, nothing else.
```

```bash

{uuid} Imagine you are {role} what is a response you would give to the question about {product}?
Only give the response, nothing else:

{question}
```
You'll then get a full dataset ready for fine-tuning, training, or anything you'd like.

## Next Steps

Once done, you will see your new dataset committed to the branch you specified. If you don't like the results, don't worry! Under the hood, all the [runs are versioned](https://www.oxen.ai/datasets/Synthetic-Persona-Customer-Support/commits/main) so you can always revert to or compare to a previous version.

We also generated some synthetic data with [Hermes 3 70B](https://www.oxen.ai/explore/models#lambda) to compare the quality, you can see the results [here](https://www.oxen.ai/datasets/Synthetic-Persona-Customer-Support).
We found that the Llama 3.1 70B model was better overall. Hermes 3 70B was very chatty, just returned nothing at times, and, perhaps because of the length of the output, took extremely long (over 2:45 hours for response gen in comparison to 28 mins for Llama 3.1 70B) to complete.

You can search through the outcomes with Oxen's [Text2SQL search](https://www.oxen.ai/datasets/Synthetic-Persona-Customer-Support/file/main/llama-v.3.1-70B.jsonl?query_id=0554627f-6da2-4d31-97a8-2181cb790b7d).
In this case, we looked for all the rows where the product column was MATLAB to compare the quality of the question and response.

```bash 
show me MATLAB in product column
```

  className="block"
  src="/images/MATLAB-demo-t2s.png"
  alt="Text2SQL example"

You can also edit the SQL query to deepen your search.

You can also run queries such as *"Give me all the rows with "Researcher" in the role column?"* or *"How many rows have "Jira" in the product column?"*

Congratulations! You've just seen how easy it is to generate synthetic data. [Let us know](https://discord.com/invite/s3tBEn7Ptg) how your experience was and if you have any improvement requests.
