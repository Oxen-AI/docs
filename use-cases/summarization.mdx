title: 'ðŸ’¡ Summarization'
description: '**Summarization** is using AI to summarizing a long piece of text. This is most commonly used with long legal documents, textbooks and educational texts, manuals, etc.'
---

This tutorial will show you how to summarize legal documents using the Model Inference feature. We will be using [o1-preview](https://www.oxen.ai/explore/models#openai) but check out the [Models Page](https://www.oxen.ai/explore/models) to see which model works best for you. 

## Find or Upload your Dataset

Open the dataset you want to work with. You can find a dataset on our [explore page](https://www.oxen.ai/explore) or you can clone the [multi_news Dataset](https://www.oxen.ai/datasets/multi_news) we are cloning.

```bash
oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/datasets/multi_news --all
export OXEN_USERNAME="your-username" # NOTE: Replace with your username
oxen create-remote --name "$OXEN_USERNAME/multi_news"
oxen config --set-remote origin "$OXEN_USERNAME/multi_news"
oxen push origin main
```

## Create a Model Evaluation

Open the file you want to summarize and press the glowing button with the rocket ðŸš€ on it at the top right of the screen.

## Setting Up The Evaluation

You will now find Oxen's model evaluation feature. This is where you can choose the model, write a prompt, and name the output column.

In this case, we are using OpenAI's [o1-preview](https://www.oxen.ai/explore/models#openai) and passing in the Text column we want to summarize.

If you'd like more tips on how to effectively prompt, check out our [blogs on prompting](https://www.oxen.ai/blog/the-prompt-report-part-1-a-systematic-survey-of-prompting-techniques)!

After selecting your model, give your evaluation a name and decide if you want to run a quick sample on a few rows or click "Next" to finalize the embedding preparations. 
Here's an example of a finished sample:

  alt="RMOD Sample Embedding"
/>

## Select Your Destination

After clicking "Next" once your sample has been completed, you will see a commiting page. Here you will decide the target branch, target path, and if you would like to commit instantly or after reviewing the embeddings.
In this case, a new branch called "Embeddings" is being created and storing the changes. Once you've decided, click "Run Evaluation".

## Monitor Your Evaluation

Feel free to grab a coffee, close the tab, or do something else while the evaluation is running. Your trusty Oxen Herd will be running in the background.

While the evaluation is running you will see a progress bar showing how many rows have been completed, an update of how many tokens are being used, and how expensive the run is so far.

## Next Steps

Once done, you will see your new dataset committed to the branch you specified. If you don't like the results, don't worry! Under the hood, all the runs are versioned so you can always revert to or compare to a previous version.

You can then search through the outcomes immediately with Oxen's Text2SQL feature. In this case, we are finding all the rows where the answer and prediction columns have different results to check o1-mini's work.

```
give me all the rows where the answer column and prediction columns are different

```

You can also run queries such as *"Give me all the rows with invoice in the query column?"* or *"How many rows have May 3rd in the answer column?"*

Congratulations! You've just seen how easy it is to use RAG on your data. Feel free to tweak your prompt, model, or dataset and see how the results change.
