In this tutorial, we will show how you can use Oxen to do sentiment analysis with GPT-4o to categorize political spam synthetic data.

## Open Your Oxen Repo
Open the dataset you want to work with. You can clone the [political spam synthetic dataset](https://www.oxen.ai/Laurence/political-spam) we are using in this example or find one in our [explore page](https://www.oxen.ai/explore) if needed.

## Set Up The Evaluation

You will now find Oxen's model evaluation feature. Here, enter the evaluation type as "text", choose the model (in this case GPT-4o), and choose if the responses should populate an existing column or a new "prediction" column.  
From there give your evaluation a name, fill in your prompt with the values you want to pass to the model, and decide if you want to run a quick sample on a few rows or click "Next" to finalize the sentiment analysis preparations:

## Set Up Your Versioning

After clicking "Next" once your sample has been completed, you will see a commiting page. Here you will decide the target branch, target path, and if you would like to commit instantly or after reviewing the output. Once decided, simply click "Run Evaluation".

## Final Outcome
While the evaluation is running you will see a progress bar showing you how many rows have been completed as well as an update of how many tokens are being used and how expensive the run is so far. Once done, you will see your new dataset right in your Oxen account.
