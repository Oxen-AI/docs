title: 'üßê Sentiment Analysis'
description: 'Sentiment analysis is the process of categorizing the overall feeling and opinion of a piece of text. For example, "Tesla''s stock skyrockets by 20%" would have positive sentiment, and "I hate when Airpods disconnect from my device" would have negative sentiment. This type of analysis can be useful for analyzing customer feedback at scale, monitoring brands on social media, predicting financial markets, and much more.'

In this tutorial, we will show how you can use Oxen to do sentiment analysis with GPT-4o to categorize political spam synthetic data.

## Open Your Oxen Repo
Open the dataset you want to work with. You can clone the [financial sentiment dataset](https://www.oxen.ai/ox/financial_sentiment) we are using or find one on our [explore page](https://www.oxen.ai/explore).

## Set Up The Evaluation

You will now find Oxen's model evaluation feature. Here, enter the evaluation type as "text", choose the model (in this case GPT-4o), and choose if the responses should populate an existing column or a new column.  
From there, give your evaluation a name, fill in your prompt with the values you want to pass to the model, and decide if you want to run a quick sample on a few rows or click "Next" to finalize the sentiment analysis preparations:

## Set Up Your Versioning

After clicking "Next" once your sample has been completed, you will see a commiting page. Here you will decide the target branch, target path, and if you would like to commit instantly or after reviewing the analysis. Once decided, simply click "Run Evaluation".

## Status Update
While the evaluation is running you will see a progress bar showing how many rows have been completed, an update of how many tokens are being used, and how expensive the run is so far.

## Next Steps
Once done, you will see your new dataset in your Oxen account. You can then search through the sentiment evaluation immediately with Oxen's Editable Dataframes feature.
