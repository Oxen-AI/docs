title: üìù Text Translation
description: 'Text translation is the process of translating text into another language. This process has never been easier with LLMs commonly supporting multiple languages such as Spanish, French, and Italian.'

For example, a marketing campaign can easily be translated from English to Spanish, you could use Oxen's Model Evaluations feature to automatically translate all ad copy. More uses include customer support, legal documents, and education.

In this tutorial, we will show how to use Oxen to translate product titles for e-commerce localization with Mistral-7B.

## Upload Your Dataset

Open the dataset you want to work with. You can find an example dataset on our [explore page](https://www.oxen.ai/explore) or if you want to follow along with the example, you can clone the [Amazon Product Sample](https://www.oxen.ai/mathias/amazon-product-sample) dataset we are using.



```bash
oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/mathias/amazon-product-sample --all
oxen create-remote --name "your-username/amazon-product-sample"
oxen config --set-remote origin "your-username/amazon-product-sample"
oxen push origin main
```

## Create a Model Evaluation

Open the file you want to translate and press the glowing button with the rocketüöÄ on it at the top right of the screen.

## Setting Up The Evaluation

You will now find Oxen's model evaluation feature. Here, select your model, give your evaluation a name, fill in your prompt with the values you want to pass to the model, and decide if you want to run a quick sample on a few rows or click "Next" to finalize the text translation preparations. If you would like some effective tips for prompting, we just posted a [blog](https://www.oxen.ai/blog/the-prompt-report-part-1-a-systematic-survey-of-prompting-techniques) on cutting-edge prompting techniques:

## Select Your Destination

After clicking "Next," you will see a commiting page. Here you will decide the target branch, target path, and if you would like to commit instantly or after reviewing the translations. Once decided, simply click "Run Evaluation".

## Monitor Your Evaluation

Feel free to grab a coffee, close the tab, or check your Duolingo streak while the evaluation is running. Your trusty Oxen Herd will be running in the background.

While the evaluation is running you will see a progress bar showing how many rows have been completed, an update of how many tokens are being used, and how expensive the run is so far.

## Next Steps

Once done, you will see your new translations committed to the branch you specified. If you don't like the results, don't worry! Under the hood, all the runs are versioned so you can always revert to or compare to a previous version.

You can then search through the translations immediately with Oxen's Text2SQL feature. Here, we are looking for the French word for fridge, frigo, to see if the correct products show up. As you can see, the only two products that are refrigerators popped up immediately.

You can also run queries such as *"What was the most product?"* or *"How many rows have descriptions in the French title?"*  to find where the LLM made mistakes to fix.

Congratulations! You've just seen how easy it is to translate text on your data with Oxen. Feel free to tweak your prompt, model, or dataset and see how the results change.
