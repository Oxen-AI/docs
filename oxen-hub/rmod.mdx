## Upload Your Dataset

Open the dataset you want to work with. You can find an example dataset on our [explore page](https://www.oxen.ai/explore) or if you want to follow along with the example, you can clone the [financial sentiment dataset](https://www.oxen.ai/ox/financial_sentiment) we are using.

```bash
oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/financial_sentiment --all
oxen create-remote --name "your-username/financial-sentiment"
oxen config --set-remote origin "your-username/financial-sentiment"
oxen push origin main
```

## Start Model Inference

Open the file you want to run inference on and press the glowing button with the rocketüöÄ on it at the top right of the screen.

## Setting Up

You will now find Oxen's model inference feature. Here, select your model, give the inference a name, fill in your prompt with the values you want to pass to the model, choose your output column, and decide if you want to run a quick sample on a few rows or click "Next" to finalize the inference preparations:



In this case, we will use [GPT-4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o) for sentiment analysis with the following prompt:

```
Compute the sentiment of the text based on how well the companies are performing in the market.
Return only one of three options: positive, negative, or neutral.
Respond with one word, all lowercase.

Text:
{text}
```

## Select Your Destination

After clicking "Next" once your sample has been completed, you will see a commiting page. Here you will decide the target branch, target path, and if you would like to commit instantly or after reviewing the analysis. Once decided, simply click "Run Evaluation".

## Monitor Your Results

Feel free to grab a coffee, close the tab, or do something else while the evaluation is running. Your trusty Oxen Herd will be running in the background.

While the evaluation is running you will see a progress bar showing how many rows have been completed, an update of how many tokens are being used, and how expensive the run is so far.

## Next Steps

Once done, you will see your new dataset committed to the branch you specified. If you don't like the results, don't worry! Under the hood, all the runs are versioned so you can always revert to or compare to a previous version.

You can then search through the sentiment evaluation immediately with Oxen's [Text2SQL feature](/oxen-hub/text2sql.mdx). In this case, we are finding all the rows with negative sentiment.

You can also run queries such as *"What was the most common sentiment?"* or *"How many rows were classified as positive?"*
