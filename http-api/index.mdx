title: "Repository API"

The Repository API drives all the versioning (VCS) functionality for [oxen.ai](https://oxen.ai) and the open-source [oxen-server](/getting-started/oxen-server).

It handles managing repositories, branches, and files among other things. Browse
the API endpoints in the sidebar to the left to see what's available. You can
also look at the [File Upload Example](/http-api/example) to see one possible
workflow for chaining these requests together.
