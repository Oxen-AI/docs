title: "Get File Metadata"
openapi: "GET /api/repos/{namespace}/{repo_name}/metadata/{resource}"
---

Get metadata for a file in a repository. This will return the file size, data type, latest commit, and other metadata about the file.

The `resource` is the combination of the revision and the path to the file to get the metadata for. For example, `main/images/image.png` would get the metadata for the `image.png` file at the `main` branch.
