Download a file from a repository.

## Example

You can download any public files without authentication.

```bash
curl -X GET \
    https://hub.oxen.ai/api/repos/ox/CatVsDogBoundingBox/file/main/images/000000000400.jpg \
    -o ~/Downloads/dog.jpg
```

## Authentication

If you want to download files from your own private repositories, you must supply the `Authorization` header with a valid token.

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    https://hub.oxen.ai/api/repos/my-namespace/my-private-repo/file/main/secret_image.png \
    -o ~/Downloads/secret_image.png
```

## Pre-signed URLs

You can also get a pre-signed URL for a file. This is useful if you want to download a file from a web page.

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    https://hub.oxen.ai/api/repos/my-namespace/my-private-repo/file/presigned_url/main/secret_image.png
```
