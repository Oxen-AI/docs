description: 'How to interact with the Oxen Filesystem to read, write and list files.'
---

Here are some examples of reading and writing files to `oxen`. Unlike `git` in order to version data in `oxen`, *you do not need to clone the full dataset*. Instead, you can directly interact with the remote repository. Let's look at some examples.

If you want to follow along, you can spin up this example [Notebook](TODO) replacing the repository names with your own.

## Add a File

Oxen.ai makes it really easy to add a file to a remote repository. It feels a lot like `git` but with all the commands operating on the remote.

```python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo("my-username/my-repo")
repo.add("my-file.txt")
repo.commit("Add my-file.txt")
```

The `add` method is what does the actual file upload. `RemoteRepo.add` is similar to `git add` putting the files in the staging area, before commit. As soon as you call `commit` the data will be versioned on the remote repository.

## List Files & Folders

Use the `ls` method on `RemoteRepo` to list all the files and folders in the root directory of a repository.

```python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo("my-username/my-repo")
repo.ls()
```

You can also pass in a directory to list the files within a directory

```python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo("my-username/my-repo")
repo.ls("images")
```

## Download a File

```python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo("my-username/my-repo")
repo.download("my-file.txt")
```

## Downloading a Directory

The same `download` method can be used to download a directory. This will recursively download all files and subdirectories, in a parallelized and efficient manner.

```python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo("my-username/my-repo")
repo.download("my-directory/")
```

## Branching

Just like `git`, Oxen allows you to create branches. This is useful when you want to experiment with your changes affecting the original version.

To add a file to a branch, you can use the `create_checkout_branch` method. This will create a new branch on the remote repository and check it out.

```python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

repo = RemoteRepo("my-username/my-repo")
repo.create_checkout_branch("my-branch")

# Add a new file
repo.add("my-changes.txt")
repo.commit("Add my-changes.txt")
```

To download that same file from the branch, you can use the `download` method with the branch name in the `revision` argument. Note: the `revision` argument can also take a commit id.

```python
repo = RemoteRepo("my-username/my-repo")
repo.download("my-changes.txt", revision="my-branch")
```

## Using FSSpec

Oxen also implements `fsspec` interfaces for remote filesystems, so you can use any of the libraries that support it. See the [fsspec docs](/python-api/oxen_fs) for more details.

This is handy for using libraries like `pandas` that support the `fsspec` interface.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read a file directly into pandas
df = pd.read_parquet("oxen://openai:gsm8k@main/gsm8k_test.parquet")

# Your code...

# Write a file to the remote repository
# NOTE: be sure to use your own username and repo name, so that you have write access
df.to_parquet("oxen://your_username:your_repo@main/gsm8k_test.parquet")
```

More generically, you can use the `OxenFS` class.

```python
import oxen

# For Oxen Hub repositories
fs = oxen.OxenFS("oxen", "Flowers")

# Read a file
with fs.open("data/train.csv") as f:
    content = f.read()

# Write with custom commit message
with fs.open("data/test.txt", mode="wb", commit_message="Added test.txt") as f:
    f.write("Hello, world!")

# You can also set/update the commit message inside the context
with fs.open("data/test.txt", mode="wb") as f:
    f.commit_message = "Updated test.txt"
    f.write("Hello, world again!")
```


## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts may happen if another client makes a commit between the time that you upload the file with `add` and call `commit`.

```python
from oxen import RemoteRepo

# Create two clients
client_1 = RemoteRepo("my-username/my-repo")
client_2 = RemoteRepo("my-username/my-repo")

# Client 1 writes a file
with open("my-changes.txt", mode="w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, world!")
client_1.add("my-changes.txt")

# Client 2 writes a file
with open("my-changes.txt", mode="w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, world again!")
client_2.add("my-changes.txt")

# Client 1 makes a commit
client_1.commit("Add my-changes.txt")

# Client 2 makes a commit with the same file
# CONFLICT!
client_2.commit("Add my-changes.txt")
```

To resolve the conflict, you can commit the changes to a new branch. This branch will be created from the commit the client was instantiating with.

```python
client_2.create_checkout_branch("my-branch")
client_2.commit("Add my-changes.txt")
```

You can then resolve the conflict manually, and merge the branch back in.
