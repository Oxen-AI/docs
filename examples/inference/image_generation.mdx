### Image Generation

The image generation endpoint allows you to generate images from text prompts. Simply provide a prompt describing the image you want to create. To see the list of models that support image generation, visit the [Models](https://www.oxen.ai/ai/models?modalities=text-to-image) page and filter by "Text to Image".

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OXEN_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen-Image",
    "prompt": "A majestic ox standing in a field at sunset",
    "num_inference_steps": 28
  }'
```

```python Python
import requests
import os

response = requests.post(
    "https://hub.oxen.ai/api/images/generate",
    headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('OXEN_API_KEY')}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={

        "prompt": "A majestic ox standing in a field at sunset",
        "num_inference_steps": 28
    }
)

# The response contains the generated image URL
image_url = response.json()["image_url"]
print(f"Generated image: {image_url}")
```
