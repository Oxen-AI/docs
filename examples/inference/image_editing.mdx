### Image Editing

The image editing endpoint allows you to edit images using AI models. Simply provide an input image URL and a prompt describing the edits you want to make. To see the list of models that support image editing, visit the [Models](https://www.oxen.ai/ai/models?modalities=image-to-image) page and filter by "Image to Image".

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST \
  https://hub.oxen.ai/api/images/edit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OXEN_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit",
    "input_image": "https://example.com/image.png",
    "prompt": "Add a funny hat to the ox",
    "num_inference_steps": 28
  }'
```

```python Python
import requests
import os

response = requests.post(
    "https://hub.oxen.ai/api/images/edit",
    headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('OXEN_API_KEY')}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "model": "Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit",
        "input_image": "https://example.com/image.png",
        "prompt": "Add a funny hat to the ox",
        "num_inference_steps": 28
    }
)

# The response contains the edited image URL
edited_image_url = response.json()["image_url"]
print(f"Edited image: {edited_image_url}")
```

</CodeGroup>

For models that support multiple input images, you can pass an array of image URLs:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL (multiple images)
curl -X POST \
  https://hub.oxen.ai/api/images/edit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OXEN_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit",
    "input_image": [
      "https://example.com/image1.png",
      "https://example.com/image2.png"
    ],
    "prompt": "Add a funny hat to the ox",
    "num_inference_steps": 28
  }'
```

```python Python (multiple images)
import requests
import os

response = requests.post(
    "https://hub.oxen.ai/api/images/edit",
    headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('OXEN_API_KEY')}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "model": "Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit",
        "input_image": [
            "https://example.com/image1.png",
            "https://example.com/image2.png"
        ],
        "prompt": "Add a funny hat to the ox",
        "num_inference_steps": 28
    }
)

edited_image_url = response.json()["image_url"]
print(f"Edited image: {edited_image_url}")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Parameters

- **model**: The model identifier to use for image editing (e.g., `Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit`)
- **input_image**: URL of the input image(s) you want to edit. Can be a string (single image URL) or an array of strings (multiple image URLs) for models that support multiple images as input
- **prompt**: Text description of the edits you want to make
- **num_inference_steps**: Number of inference steps (optional, defaults vary by model)

## Playground Interface

The model playground allows you to quickly test out the boundaries of any model in the UI. This is a great way to experiment with different prompts and see how the model performs before integrating it into your application.

<img 
  src="/images/inference/image-editing/playground.png" 
  alt="Image editing playground"
  className="rounded-xl"

The generated images automatically get saved to a dataset that you can share with your team, download and use to train your own model, or use in your application.
