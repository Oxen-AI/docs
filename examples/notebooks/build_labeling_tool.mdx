title: üè∑Ô∏è Custom Labeling Tool
description: Rate random examples from your dataset and write them back to a data frame before committing.

TODO: This is blocked on the `DataFrame` API being able to `get_row` from a remote repo that it does not have access to. Which right now is confusing because there is a PyWorkspaceDataFrame and a PyDataFrame.

Oxen's [DataFrame](/python-api/dataframe) APIs make it easy to build a custom labeling tool.

Here's an example of a simple function that reads random examples from a dataset:

```python
from oxen import RemoteRepo, DataFrame
import random
def get_random_example(repo_name: str, path: str):
    repo = RemoteRepo(repo_name)
    remote_df = DataFrame(repo, path)
    height, width = remote_df.size()
    return remote_df.get_row(random.randint(0, height - 1))
```

Then writes the ratings back to the dataset:

```python
def write_ratings(df: pd.DataFrame, ratings: pd.DataFrame):
    """Write the ratings back to the dataset."""
    df.update(ratings)
```
